Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting this report, I should like to thank my colleagues and members of the Council for the help they gave ne during the year under review. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Hneche Medical Officer of Health. Page 5 GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH SHORTAGE OF HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION The completion of the planning of the scheme for enlarging the Barking Hospital into a general hospital is scheduled to be completed in 1960. HEALTH EDUCATION For a week in September, the new Town Hall was open for inspection by the public and an exhibition illustrating the local services was staged in the Small Hall. Included in the Health Section of the Exhibition were displays dealing with the personal health services and accidents in the home. The Exhibition was visited by five to six thousand people. The theme for the routine autumn Home Safety Campaign was "Check that Fall", promoted in conjunction with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. A wide distribution of propaganda material was made. In order to provide a balanced programme of health education material, a small section of the central officehas now been allocated to do this work in conjunction with clinics, health visitors, etc. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 It is pleasing to report that at no time during the year was it necessary to invoke Section 47 of this Act to secure the compulsory removal to hospital of a Barking resident. WELFARE SERVICES The following information was kindly supplied by the County Welfare Officer of the Essex County Council:- The statistics set out below show the extent to which the main services provided by the County Welfare Commit'^ Under the National Assistance Act, 1948, have beenaffo^e Page 6 to persons residing within the Borough of Barking during the yea: 1959:- (1) Residential and Temporary Accommodation (a) Admitted to hostels and other residential establishments: Men, 12; Women, 11. The number of persons emanating from the Borough in residential accommodation provided by or on behalf of the County Council as at 31st December 1959, was as follows: Men, 27; Women, 40. (b) Admitted to temporary accommodation for homeless families: Men -; Women, 2; Children, 6. The County Council propose to provide a purposebuilt Home for Old People in the Borough which will accommodate 60 residents, and it is anticipated that building work will be commenced during the year 1960/ 61. (2) Blind Persons The number of registered blind, partially sighted and defective sighted persons resident in the Borough on the 31st December, 1959 was as follows:- (i) Registered as blind 117 (") Partially sighted 42 (iii) Defective sighted 6 of whom came under the supervision of the County Council's Home Teachers. There was one blind resident in the Home Workers Scheme operated through the agency of the Royal Society for the Blind and two were employed in special Workshops for the blind. Additionally, seventeen blind and twelve partially sighted persons were employed in open industry and one blind resident from the Borough was fitted to a Home for the Blind. Occupational and reecreational facilities are also available to the blind and many are taught braille and handicraft. Page 7 Deaf or Dumb and other Handicapped Classes The Welfare services for physically handicapped persons (other than blind, as mentioned above) as provided under Section 29 of the National Assistance Act 1948 have been extended considerably and assistance is afforded where necessary in respect of holidays, adaptations to homes to facilitate mobility, the provision of special equipment, ranging from bath seats to hydraulic hoists etc. An all-day Occupational Centre at Eastbury House, Barking, has been running for nearly two years and notonly persons from Barking, but those from parts of Ilford and Dagenham, attend. This Centre is a very happy feature and is giving pleasure to many handicapped persons as it provides occupation in various handicrafts, and a social life which, through their handicaps, had previously been limited, Also the fullest co-operation has been maintained with specialised organisations in this field of welfare services, many of these bodies acting as the Council's agents in this connection. MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH Population The estimated population of Barking at each raid-year for the past decade, as notified by the Registrar General, is given below:- 1950 79,260 1951 78,170 (Census) 1952 77,140 1953 76,800 1954 76,580 1955 75,990 1956 75,560 1957 75,070 1958 74,850 1959 74,980 Page 8 Births 969 live births and 15 still-births were registered during 1959, as under:- Live Births:- Males Females Total Legitimate 466 467 933 Illegitimate 20 16 36 Totals 486 483 969 Still-Births:- Legitimate 5 10 15 Illegitimate - - ~ Totals 5 10 15 Total Live and Still-Births 491 493 984 Birth Rate per 1,000 of Estimated Population 12.92.

Maternal Mortality It is pleasing to report that no maternal deaths occurred during the year. Loss of Infant Life The infant death rate in 1959 was 28.95 as compared with 18.54 for 1958. The national figures for these years were 22.2 and 22.6 respectively. Page 9 The following tables show the causes of infant deaths:- INFANTILE MORTALITY - 1959 Cause of Death Age at Death 0-1 mth. 1-3 mths. 3-6 mths. 6-9 mths. 9-12 mths.

Page 11 DIPHTHERIA It is pleasing to report, after the outbreak of last year, that no notification of diphtheriawas received during the year. POLIOMYELITIS Neither of the two cases notified during the year had been vaccinated against poliomyelitis. One case was a boy of 4 years who developed slight paralytic symptoms in the legs, but the other did not develop paralysis and the diagnosis was not confirmed by virological examination. CARE OF THE AGED Throughout the year Health Visitors continued to visit the aged in their homes, and resulting therefrom action was taken in many instances to procure necessary treatment and help where needed. One of the most appreciated services which is given on the recommendation of the health visitor's visit is domiciliary chiropody. This is provided by the Barking Old People's Welfare Committee and at the end of the year 210 old people were receiving this service, an increase of 25 over the previous year. It is interesting to note that the average ageof the people receiving this service was 76 years. During the year there has been constant and cordial contact with hospitals receiving the chronic sick and with the County Welfare Department. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Licences were issued during the year in respect of four establishments which are governed by the Borough's bye. laws. Page 12 LAUNDRY SERVICE Once again the Borough Council's laundry service proved an invaluable adjunct to the services provided in the home to care for the chronic sick. During the year 45 cases were assisted. PATHOLOGICAL SERVICE Dr. T.F. Elias-Jones has very kindly given me the following report on the Pathological Services administered by him during 1959:- There is a close and mutually beneficial association between the Barking Public Health Department and the constituent laboratories of the Ilford and Barking Hospital Group Pathology Service, particularly the laboratory at Barking Hospital. Haematological (and other) investigations of expectant mothers constitute an important part of the work done in this connection. These are undertaken not only for patients attending the Borough's ante-natal clinics in preparation for hospital or domiciliary confinement, but also for those to be confined at home whose ante-natal care is supervised by family doctors. In the organization of this work, for both categories of patients, the helpful co-operation of the Borough Health Department's Medical Officers, Health Visitors, Midwives and Clerks is greatly appreciated by the laboratory staff. Insofar as timely laboratory investigations during pregnancy can help to safeguard the life and health of the mother and her baby - and they can help a great deal - it can be fairly stated that no expectant mother in Barking need be denied precautionary aid against the predictable hazards of Pregnancy and delivery. This must be stressed because, either through ignorance of the existence of these facilities or because of prejudicial reluctance to use them, a small minority of Barking women still do not fully avail themselves of this service. Page 13 A plea often heard in the past, in mitigation of failure to attend for laboratory appointments, was the difficulty of access to Barking Hospital. With the inauguration of the No. 62 Bus Service along Upney Lane - bearing in mind, too, that the Hospital adjoins Upney Station - this excuse can no longer be tenable. Following on these ante-natal - and post-natal investigations of the mothers, the help of the pathology department is frequently enlisted by doctors in charge of the Infant WelfareClinics, e.g. a well-chosen laboratory test may reveal the cause of a baby's failure to thrive. In later childhood pupils suspected, at school medical inspection,to be suffering from subacute rheumatism, anaemia or other blood disorders etc. are also referred. In such cases positive results enable the child to be directed, without delay, to the appropriate hospital or specialist clinic, whereas negative laboratory findings help to dispel the anxieties of parents and doctor. The pathology department also receives a large number of swabs and other specimens submitted by the Area Medical Officers in the course of their epidemiological investigations. Apart from bacillary dysentery, sporadic cases (or small outbreaks in families or other closely-linked communities) of which are continually occurring, investigations have not uncovered any epidemic of note during the year. Laboratory specimens submitted from other clinics (Minor Ailments Clinics, Skin Clinics etc.) add precision to clinical diagnosis and provide guidance to treatment. Nowadays the greater part of this work involves the identification of micro-organisms causing particular infections in individual patients and, following on this, the selection, by precise tests, of the antibiotic or other antimicrobial dreg likely to prove beneficial. As is well known the most prevalent cause of septic infections at the present time is the Staphylococcus aureus, an organism which, unhappily, shows an astonishing facility in its defiance of antibiotics. The accompanying table gives a summary of the effectiveness of three out of the many antibiotics which were tested against 281 strains of these organisms at the Barking Page 14 Hospital Laboratory during 1959. Strains isolated from hospital inpatients. Strains isolated from outpatients (attending P.H. Clinics, G.P's etc.) Total no. of strains of Staph-aureus tested 213 68 Penicillin-resistant strains 175 (82.2%) 32 (47.0%) Streptomycin-resistant strains 88 (41.3%) 5 ( 7.3%) Tetracycline-resistant strains 85 (39.8%) 6( 8.8%) The contrast between the behaviour of hospital staphylococci and those isolated from patients attending Public Health clinics or their family doctors is very strikingly illustrated. It will be seen, for example, that while, in hospital, the efficacy of penicillin in this type of infection has clearly reached its nadir, its usefulness even in domiciliary and clinic practice has dwindled to about half of what it was ten years ago. The obvious lesson to be learned from figures such as these is that it is only by laboratorycontrolled discrimination in their use can these potentially powerful agents, which have flowed in such profusion from Sir Alexander Fleming's great discovery, continue to play their part in the continuing battle against microbial infection. In all these endeavours it is essential that the harmonious integration of public health, general practitioner and laboratory services should be fostered and maintained.

Two members of your nursing staff are seconded to clinic to assist at clinic sessions and home visiting. Page 16 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES This section deals with those services which come under the control of the Barking Health Area Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the Essex County Council. CLINIC PREMISES Health Services Clinic - Thames View Estate The building of this Clinic commenced during the year and was almost completed at the end of December. A proposal was made that the family doctors running the group practice on the Estate should be given the opportunity of renting accommodation in the clinic instead of operating from the temporary surgery building. CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN maternity service Ante-Natal Care. This was given as follows:- Clinics 739 Hospitals (excluding Barking Hospital) 165 General Practitioners 57 Total 961 Confinements. During the year 964 mothers were confined, giving birth to 984 infants (including 20 sets of twins). These were born as follows:- Barking Hospital 545 Other Hospitals 171 At home 268 Total 984 In four instances, patients failed to seek ante-natal care and of these cases three of the children were illegitimate and in the fourth the baby was premature. Paae 17 Post-Natal Care. 497 Barking mothers attended the PostNatal Clinic making a total of 586 attendances. In addition 251 mothers were under the care of their family doctors and 165 were under the care of hospitals outside the district.

District Midwives undertook the confinement of 262 patients which represented 27% of the births occurring in the Borough. Supervision of Midlines Dr. M. I. Adamson continued as Medical Supervisor of Midwives and Miss D. Riseley, Matron of the Barking Hospital, continued to act as Non-medical Supervisor of Midwives until her retirement in November. health visiting The following statistics relate to the work of health visitors:- HEALTH VISITING 1958 1959 No. of visits to Expectant Mothers 1,266 1,266 No. of visits to Children under five 9,251 8,533 No. of other visits 5,712 6,692 No. of Non-Access visits 2,270 2,223 home nursing This service, together with approximately half of the domiciliary midwifery service, is still administered from the County Train in g Home at Leytonstone. Page 19 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION Smallpox Vaccination The number of primary vaccinations carried out in 1959 was 114 in infants under one year, 153 in those over one year. This means that just over 10% of infants are being vaccinated during the first year of life. Poliomyelitis Vaccination In my last report I recorded that the response from young people in the age group 16 - 25 years had been disappointingly low and in fact only 118 had received 2 injections by the end of 1958. Early in 1959, therefore, it was decided to supplement the usual propaganda channels by offering vaccination 'on the spot' at places of work and recreation, e.g. factories, schools, youth centres. This did stimulate the acceptance rate somewhat but it was not until the untimely death of a young national footballer took place that any significant response was received from this age group when 8,000 injections were given to young adults during the ensuing two months. Difficulties of supply of vaccine during this time did cause the department some embarrassment in that we had to suspend for some time the open sessions when young people could be vaccinated without appointment. By the end of 1959 about one-third of the young people between 15 and 25 years of age had been vaccinated. During the year over 10,000 booster doses were given to children under 15 years of age. With regard to expectant mothers, 490 were vaccinated, i.e. about one-half of the total possible. Page 20 Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation The number of children receiving primary courses of immunisation during the year was as follows:- DIPHTHERIA Family doctors Clinics Total Separate 197 417 614 Combined with whooping cough 116 - 116 Total diphtheria 313 417 730 WHOOPING COUGH Family doctors Clinics Total Separate 152 379 531 Combined with diphtheria 116 - 116 Total whooping cough 268 379 647 PREVENTION OF ILLNESS, CARE AND AFTER-CARE Chiropody Service This remains a popular service and during the year 17,242 attendances were made. Sick Room Equipment This continues to be much in demand and helps greatly assist the nursing of patients at home. At the end of the year 789 articles were out on loan. Page 21 DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE The following table shows the number of hours of service given during the past ten years, together with a detailed analysis of how the hours of service were deployed in 1959:- Year Number of Helps Employed Number of Cases Helped Total Hours Worked 1950 . 55 387 80,699 1951 49 327 70,611 1952 84 318 85,743 1953 89 384 105,121 1954 89 503 101,960 1955 90 556 105,104 1956 93 596 104,863 1957 93 581 97,536 1958 97 550 103,787 1959 96 625 114,227 The following table shows the help given to various categories during 1959:- Category Cases Helped 1959 Hours of Service 1959 Maternity 55 3,712 Acute Sick 17 1,349 Tuberculosis 14 4,881 Chronic Sick 109 25,570 Aged chronic sick 312 58,097 Aged 106 19,219 Others 12 1,399 Total 625 114,227 Page 22 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE, 1959 MEDICAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT The Statistical Return at the end of this report shows the classification of defects found and the treatment thereof. Minor Ailment Clinics Attendances at these clinics were well maintained during the year. CASES TREATED AT MINOR AILMENT CENTRES EYES: (External and other - excluding errors of refraction and squint) 394 EARS, NOSE AND THROAT DEFECTS: (other than operative) 640 SKIN: Ringworm (body) 5 Scabies 1 Impetigo 90 Other 2,581 Other minor ailments (e.g. minor injuries, bruises, sores, chilblains, etc.) 1,614 Total attendances 22,083 Speech Therapy During the year 203 cases made 2,114 attendances to the speech clinics. During term time the Speech Therapists continue to give sessions per week at Faircross School. DENTAL SERVICES Statistics relating to the dental inspection and treatment of school children will be found in the statistical return at end of this report. Page 23 Our only full-time dentist resigned in the autumn and although with the help of part-time dentists we were able to operate at least one dental clinic it was quite impossible to maintain a satisfactory service for school children. It is several years now since some schools had a routine dental inspection. The Dental Laboratory continues to construct dentures and appliances not only for Barking but for many dental centres elsewhere in the County. VACCINATION AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS This service, called B.C.G. vaccination, was introduced to Barking during the Autumn of 1954 and has operated since that time. It was restricted to school children aged between 13 and 14 years but has recently been extended to include students attending technical colleges or other establishments of further education. As vaccination is indicated only in persons who have never been infected with tuberculosis a pre-vaccination tuberculin sensitivity test is necessary to detect previously infected persons. We decided from the beginning of the scheme to carry out two such tests simultaneously, namely the Mantoux test which consists of the intradermal injection of 0.1 ml. (10 TU) of a solution of P.P.D. supplied by the Ministry of Health, and a test first described by Heaf in 1951 and known as the Heaf multiple puncture test. Doctors Martin and Seligmann who carried oui the bulk of this tuberculin testing and result reading, both attended a course of instruction in the necessary techniques prior to the commencement of the scheme. The results we obtained on over 3,000 school children are compared below:- Number Year Tested 1954 214 1955 675 1956 751 1957 863 1956 723 Page 24 Total No. of Reactors 23 96 97 71 75 Heaf Test Positive Results 23 96 93 70 75 Mantoux Test positi"' Results 22 86 97 71 73 These results indicate close agreement (97%) between the two methods, and, in view of the ease and simplicity of operation particularly with the self-firing apparatus now available, we decided to rely in future on the Heaf test for mass skin-testing in this connexion. During the current year B.C.G. vaccination was again offered to all 13-year old children and below are statistics relating to this service:- Number to whom offered 1,368 Number tuberculin tested after parents' consent had been received 1,140 Positive result 71 Negative result 1,069 Number who received B.C.G 1,069 As a result of the extension of the scheme, students of the South-East Essex Technical College were invited to participate although only 55 out of 644 accepted. Of this number 48 were tested (7 were absent); 9 had positive reactions and the remaining 39 received B.C.G. All positive reactors are referred to the Chest Physician who examines each case carefully for signs of active disease. SPECIALIST SERVICES Eye Clinics Dr. R.F. Jamieson, M.B., Ch.B., D.O.M.S., continues to attend Central, Porters Avenue and Woodward Clinics. Cases dealt with were as follows:- External and other diseases excluding errors of refraction and squint 75 Errors of refraction (including squint) 1,156 Total 1,231 Page 25 The number of pupils for whom spectacles were prescribed was 928. Miss Lewis, Orthoptist, treated 138 school children during 1959. Vision Testing. The importance of good vision to the optimal development and educational attainment of children is widely acknowledged as children cannot develop to the full unless they have the full use of their senses, including that of vision. There is obviously a need to discover those children who have visual defects, but unfortunately a preschool child with defective vision is unlikely to receive attention unless the defeGt is gross or is associated with squint. In some cases the defect is not discovered until the child is able to read his letters - at age 7-8 on average - by which time the defect may have progressed too far for correction and the child is later found to have a useless eye, a condition called unilateral amblyopia which is really a preventable disability. There is no simple remedy for this state of affairs, as screen testing the vision of school entrants and pre-school children has always presented peculiar difficulties because children of this age group are normally illiterate and cannot or will not co-operate in the examination. There are various test methods available but all have limitations and no single test is both feasible and infallible We have been trying various methods on our older day nursery children and in pupils attending the nursery school class with the co-operation of the teaching staff, and the trials seem to indicate that a little known test may prove useful. Further trials are planned in a search for a reliable method for use in our vision screening programme. Paediatric Clinic A Consultant Paediatrician, Dr. T. Savage, of the Regional Hospital Board holds a session each fortnight a. Page 26 the Upney Clinic and during 1959 school children were seen as follows:- New cases 41 Re-examination 197 Total Attendances 238 Ear, Nose and Throat Clinics Miss M. Mason, F.R.C.S., continues as the Consultant Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist and has made the following notes on the work of her clinic:- "The Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic has progressed satisfactorily during the past year. There is at the moment no appreciable waiting list for appointments. Local arrangements are made for those patients who, after being seen, are in need of X-Rays, most of these being carried out at Barking Hospital but those requiring more detailed X-Rays are referred to King George Hospital, Ilford. For some time now the list of children awaiting operative treatment for tonsils and adenoids has been gradually reducing and the time lapse between the recommendation and the admission to Hospital is now between eight and ten weeks. Urgent cases are admitted within one to two weeks. The beds made available for E.N.T. cases at Chadwell Heath Hospital have mainly been responsible for the reduction in waiting time for these operations but there are also regular admissions to King George Hospital, Ilford. Older children and adults, however, have to wait considerably longer for operative treatment owing to the long list of patients awaiting various types of surgery." Page 11 Figures for treatment are:- Operative treatment (cases):- (a) For diseases of the ear 1 (b) For adenoids and chronic tonsillitis 120 (c) For other nose and throat conditions 12 Other forms of treatment (cases) 206 Orthopaedic Clinic Mr. Leon Gillis, M.B.E., F.R.C.S., continues as the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon and attends fortnightly at the Physiotherapy Department, Barking Hospital. Mr. Gillis has very kindly made the following observations, inter alia, on the work of the department during 1959. "There are several points I would like to make. One is that this clinic continues to have a tremendous turnover and serves the need of the surrounding population extraordinarily well - in spite of the present shortage of staff - under the able guidance of Mr. T. Hynd, Superintendent Physiotherapist. Another point is that we are continuing to admit cases from this area to the following hospitals:- East Ham Memorial Hospital, St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow, St. John's Hospital, Battersea and Queen Mary's Hospital Roehampton, and due to the shortage of beds in these hospitals, I am now having more difficulty in getting the cases admitted. The following are some of the cases we have admitted to the above mentioned hospitals during 1959:- Oueen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton 4 - adult males - admitted for investigation and prolonged treatment. Page 28 St. John's Hospital, Battersea 2 - adult females - admitted for investigation and prolonged treatment. East Ham Memorial Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow 10 adults - admitted for various types of surgical treatment such as Removal of coccyx Removal of loose bodies Excision of ganglion Bilateral Keller's Lengthening of tendo-achilles and tenotomy of plantar fascia. 2 children - admitted for surgical treatment. In addition, from time to time, it is necessary for me to admit to East Ham Memorial Hospital babies who require repeated manipulations and plaster for the correction of talipes. It does seem anomalous that the Hospital which is situated in the Borough of Barking and is, in fact, the Hospital which was built for the residents, cannot have its own patients admitted, whereas patients from other Boroughs can gain admission for their various ailments. One further point, could something perhaps be done to encourage Physiotherapists and other ancillary staff to come to Barking." (As a footnote to the comments by Mr. Gillis it is appropriate to record that plans are well in hand for increasing the bed complement at the Barking Hospital and to turn it into a general hospital; also every endeavour is being made to tecruit further physiotherapists to the hospitals administered W the Ilford and Barking Group Hospital Management Committee.) Page 29 The number of school children referred to Mr. Gillis during the year was 64. Skin Clinic Dr. P.M. Deville, M.R.C.P., M.R.C.S., Consultant Dermatologist, attends the Skin Clinic at Upney Clinictwice a month, and during the year 916 attendances were made to his clinic. Child Guidance The number of cases referred to the Child Guidance Clinic numbered 24. Participation in case conferences has continued to be of invaluable help and interest, and we are grateful to Dr. W. Gurassa, Consultant Psychiatrist, and his team at the clinic for their enthusiastic support. It gives me pleasure to include the following report by Dr. Gurassa on the work of his clinic:- "There have been a number of changes in staff during the past year, principally in the appointment of myself as Medical Director in place of Dr. Davidson, and Miss Watt as Psychologist in place of Mr. Pickett, the latter appointment after a gap of several months. We have been fortunate in obtaining permission to appoint an additional Psychiatric Social Worker, who is very much needed to relieve the pressure on our two present Social Workers. These changes have necessitated the renewal of contact with various agencies concerned with children in the area, in particular the schools where the lack of a Psychologist was acutely felt. We have endeavoured to continue and extend Dr. Davidson's policy of integrating the clinic's activities with those of other agencies concerned with the education and welfare of children, and the current year has seen a Considerable increase of contact with such people as Head Teachers, Probation Officers, School Attendance Officers etc., so that we are increasingly Page 30 learning to understand each other's points of view, and to co-ordinate the help given to children and parents. Meetings were also arranged with School Medical Officers and Health Visitors, and it is pleasing to note that Health Visitors are regularly attending our Conferences and working closely with us. The diagnostic waiting list has been reduced considerably, and it is possible to see new referrals much sooner than before, There is still a delay with regard to the provision of more intensive treatment, and it is intended to reduce this by providing group treatment. We have been considering ways in which we can extend our activities during the next year. It is hoped to provide at least one evening session for diagnosis and treatment. This will be of particular benefit to children who have left school and need to continue treatment here, and also to allow selected children to attend out of school time. Most of our cases are still referred from School Medical Officers, but we do have an increasing number from general practitioners, who, in some instances are able to attend our Conferences. One disturbing note is the continued lack of facilities in the area for the admission of disturbed children and adolescents to suitable Units for observation and treatment. Many other areas have provided such Units but they are only available to us in exceptional circumstances. Some interim measures are urgently required pending more permanent provisions in the remote future. In summing up I would say that while we are mainly occupied with the treatment and supervision of children referred to us we are increasingly concerned with ""proving our contact and communication with all people who are interested in the Welfare of children with the particular aim of helping to prevent the development of established nervous disorders.

At the end of the year there were 179 pupils at Faircross Special School distributed as follows:- Barking Other Districts E.S.N. Section 42 60 Open Air Section 25 50 E.S.N. Section. During the year 17 children left the E.S.N Section on ceasing to be of compulsory school age (5 Barking and 12 out-of-district) - all were recommended for supervision by the Local Health Authority under Section 57(5) of the Education Act, 1944. Seven children (2 Barking and 5 out-of-district) were found to be ineducable and recommended for action under Section 57(3) of the Education Act, 1944. Page 32 Two children (1 Barking and 1 Ilford) were transferred to Residential Special Schools for E.S.N, pupils. One Barking child returned to an ordinary school and one Romford child was transferred to a Day School for Deaf Children. Open-Air Section During the year 13 delicate and 6 physically handicapped children were admitted from Barking and the surrounding districts. The following table shows the number of children in attendance on the 31st December, 1959, together with the medical condition for which they were admitted.

This responsibility is well undertaken by Dr. Violet Spiller in close association with the teaching staff. Regular physiotherapy, remedial exercises, postural drainage and other remedial treatment is available at the school, and speech therapy sessions are held four times weekly during term time. During the year 12 children (4 Barking and 8 out-ofdistrict) were no longer considered to require special educational treatment - 6 returned to ordinary schools and 6, aged 15, were allowed to leave school. In addition, one East Han child transferred to a Day Special School for Educationally Sub-Normal pupils and one Barking child was admitted to a Residential Special School for Maladjusted pupils.

The Essex County Council has not provided or received any approval to provide an old people's hostel in the Borough. The Borough Council is building a second block of small flats comprising 4 One bedroom Flats 8 Double Bed/Sit Flats 12 Single Bed/Sit Flats at Westbury Road and Ripple Road corner now the site is cleared, similar to the popular Mayflower House accommodation but without County Council assistance. RENT ACT, 1957 When this Act became law some 2½ years ago there was the hope that substantial repairs would be carried out to the older property in the Borough. This has not been the result. There was an immediate response by owners where properties required repointing externally, but for other maintenance repairs tenants had to resort to the service of the statutory notices. The early rush for certificates of disrepair has faded out and our present figures appear to indicate that our annual rate of applications has been reached. The following gives details of action during the year:- Number of enquiries ("G" Forms issued) 22 Applications for Certificate of Disrepair 30 Undertakings received after a "Notice of Intention to serve a Certificate of Disrepair" 22 Certificates of Disrepair issued 14 Cancellation of Certificate of Disrepair (after work completed to satisfaction of tenant) 11 Certificate of Disrepair issued after owner had failed to comply with undertaking to occupier Page 46 A visit by a Public Health Inspector was made to the houses of 22 occupiers asking for "G" forms, to offer advice on their completion. Revisits are made after application for cancellation has been received from the owner. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Housing Acts 1949/1957 It was to be expected that the rent increases allowed under the Rent Act 1957, together with the grants in aid for the improvement of sub-standard houses would have prevented the further deterioration of such houses. Although the Council continues to make grants, the applications received are from owner occupiers. Grants for the improvement of housing accommodation were approved in respect of six applications, the cost of the work amounting in the aggregate to £1,702. 2. 6d. Improvement Grants amounting to £976. 8. 9d were granted. The conclusion to be drawn from our experience in Barking is that owners of rented houses are unwilling to sink further money in the property unless by compulsion, or when vacant possession offers an opportunity for sale. HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 On July 1st 1959 the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959 came into force. Previously the payment of grants had been at the will of the local authority. The new Act provided that where a house has a minimum "life" of 15 years, a grant shall be Paid equal to half the cost of certain standard amenities, subject to a maximum grant of £155. This new type of grant is known as a Standard Grant. Page 47 The standard amenities are:- (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (b) a wash-hand basin; (c) a hot water supply; (d) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; (e) satisfactory facilities for the storing of food. The discretionary grant which is still available allows a wider range of improvements with a maximum grant of £400, Since the Act came into force there have been 14 applications for standard grants, 12 of which were approved for works valued £1,340. There were also 11 applications during the year for discretionary grants relating to works valued at £4,192.17.3d. Information re Local Land Charges etc. Information as to statutory orders in respect of dwelling houses and as to notices not complied with requiring works of repair was supplied in respect of 648 properties upon request for official search of the Land Charges Register. Because of slum clearance procedure there is an increasing number of inquiries as to the "future life" of properties in the Borough. Section C - FOOD SUPPLIES The regular Food and Drugs sampling carried out by your officers during the year has revealed that in the main our foodstuffs are of sound quality and within the statutory standards. Samples totalled 194 of which 22 were formal and 172 informal. The Public Analyst, Dr. J.H. Hamence reported that 9 samples were not genuine. Immediate notification to the manufacturers resulted in satisfactory action being taken. The public is becoming accustomed to the frozen food market. Most of the provision stores, greengrocers and many Page 48 butchers have installed the modern deepfreeze self service cabinets, containing a complete range of foodstuffs of good quality, hygienically packed and in the prime of condition at the time of purchase. Probably the only disadvantage arising is the short life of the food after removal from deepfreeze. Complaints and Prosecutions Complaints brought to this office during the year indicate that continual supervision and regular inspections are necessary where food is manufactured, prepared, stored or sold to prevent contamination and to ensure that such food does not deteriorate during-storage or delivery before sale. Two local traders were prosecuted for selling food not of the quality demanded. The cafe proprietors sold adulterated milk and one in addition substituted margarine for butter. Fines were imposed in both cases. Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 A general improvement has taken place throughout the retail food shops and cafes as a result of substantial alterations. These changes have provided food rooms capable of being easily cleansed with preparation surfaces constructed of the new hard wearing plastics, more display cabinets protecting the food, and improved hygiene. Some of the multiple shops have carried out complete modern refitting, usually in close co-operation with this department, resulting Mi larger window areas, better through ventilation and improved storage of food and display facilities. During the Council's exhibition held in the Town Hall in September considerable emphasis was given to food hygiene by short lectures to the hundreds of housewives, local traders and school children that attended. onion Peeling Food Hygiene (Amendment Regulations) 1957 1958 the Council decided that the necessary hygiene reqierments could not be met at the houses of those Page 49 cants who wished to carry out this type of work. The distributing firm later made arrangements for the onion peeling to be carried out in workplaces outside the Borough. There are no registered premises in the Borough. Condemned Food Two large distributors of grocery provisions have taken over new warehouses in the Borough. This has resulted in a considerable increase in the amount of food to be examined. These distributors also collect from shops they supply alleged unsound food which needs inspection and frequently, condemnation. The occurrence of the very warm summer played a part in the deterioration of some meat and meat products. FOOD PREMISES The following is a list of the various premises in the Borough used for the sale of food:- Bakehouses 5 Bread and Cake Shops 21 Butchers Shops 46 Confectionery Shops 82 Factory canteens 56 Fishmongers and Fish Fryers 23 Fruiterers and Greengrocers 43 Grocery Shops 121 Ice Cream Manufactureres 2 Ice Cream Vendors 140 Milk Shops 43 Public Houses and Off Licensed Premises 34 Public House Restaurants 8 Restaurants 48 School Meal Centres and Kitchens 45 Street Traders 29 Page 50 INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES During the year the following inspections were made and notices served:- Number of visits 2,577 Number of defective or dirty walls, ceilings and floors 38 Number of notices to repair or provide hot water fittings Nil Number of notices to repair counters and tables and cupboards 5 Number of notices to repair drains and yard paving 3 Number of notices to provide sinks and washhand basins 1 Number of notices to repair or renew defective sanitary fitments 19 Number of notices to prevent contamination of food 9 Number of notices to provide suitable and sufficient lighting 1 Number of notices to stop and prevent smoking 1 Number of notices to provide first aid equipment 1 Number of notices to remove accumulations of waste 12 On occasions the inspecting officers gave verbal notices to remedy minor defects where it was not considered necessary to serve written notice.

One of the two manufacturers operating in the Borough lanufactures for national distribution. With this large national distributor supplying ice cream n bulk and in prepacked units for resale a constant check upon chemical and bacteriological quality of this product is ssential. Our samples are submitted to the Public Health Laboratory controlled by the Ministry of Health. During the year there were some complaints from local authorities in the distribution area with regard to coliform findings resulting from bacteriological examination. At no time was the contamination reported serious, nor did it accord with the laboratory results we were receiving in Barking. It is unreasonable to expect that all laboratories will produce the same results in detail and it may be that wide examination of supplies distributed nationally is a good thing, notwithstanding the control work in the area of production. At no time was there any complaint about the chemical quality of the product. Lollies The factory where ice cream is produced for distribution on a national scale also manufactures Lollies, with a similar distribution. The products were regularly sampled and found free from lead contamination. During the year 47 samples of Ice Cream have been submitted to the Methylene Blue examination. Sports on the samples submitted are recorded as under:- Fourteen samples of Ice Cream were obtained for chemical analysis and all were reported to be satisfactory. Page 55 Examination of the Ice Cream samples showed a fat content much in excess of the present standards for fat content. Thirty four samples of Lollies were analysed and found to be satisfactory.

Each is provided with modern refrigerators, adequate sinks and washhand basins with constant hot and cold water supplies. Of these shops, 16 are also fitted with modern refrigerated window stalls and display cabinets. Each of these butchers shops has a properly constructed glazed front thus preventing contamination of the meat deposited for sale to the public from dust and dirt from the streets and surroundings. There are no slaughterhouses in the Borough. Meat supplies generally are obtained from Smithfield Market, and are of high standard. Two meat retailers in the district have animals slaughtered at their own slaughterhouses outside the area. MANUFACTURE OF SAUSAGES At the present time there are 35 premises registered for the manufacture of sausages. One of these establishments is a central factory for several butchers shops under the same control. Another factory produces sausages and other cooked foods for the wholesale trade and distributes over a wide area of London and the County of Essex. The remaining 33 premises are butchers shops where the sausages are made and sold in conjunction with their trade. Routine regular sampling for chemical analysis has been maintained and it is noteworthy to record that although there still remains an absence of official standard for meat content sausages, on no occasion has there been a sample reported below 50% for Beef Sausages and 65% for Pork sausages.

The meat content of hamburgers is a matter requiring definition, with the increasing sales of this form of "snack meal.

Page 64 This is to be achieved by making Smoke Control Orders under the powers given to Local Authorities in Section 11 of the Clean Air Act. The effect of such an order is to prohibit the emission of smoke from any chimney in the area to which it applies. A survey will be necessary covering approximately five thousand houses each year to take a complete record of heating and cooking appliances so that an estimate can be made of the cost of adapting unsuitable appliances to enable smokeless fuel to be used. During the year a start was made on the survey of the first, area which will comprise 2,056 Barking Council dwellings, 1,956 London County Council dwellings and 830 private dwellings. Preliminary information will be required by the Minister of Housing and Local Government so that he can make sure sufficient smokeless fuel will be available in the area. The main burden of the needs will be met by coke which the Gas Board say is in ample supply. A coke suitable for burning on domestic continuous burning grates is now produced to a standard specification and is marketed as "Gloco". Joint Conference Three meetings of the Joint Conference of neighbouring Local Authorities were held to discuss matters of common interest in the administration of the Clean Air Act. Arising from the Conference several matters were taken up the Minister of Housing and Local Government and other bodies. The question of the shortage of smokeless fuels other than coke was raised with the Minister of Fuel and Power, who was also asked to consider the processing of coal into smokeless fuel at the pit head. A protest was made to the Coal Utilisation Council, the Independent Television Authority and the Minister of Power about the advertisements on television encouraging the use of coal on open fires. All three replied that there is no legal Page 65 reason why coal should not be used in houses not in smoke control areas and that by encouraging the use of coal more smokeless fuel would be made available for use in smokeless areas. The Minister of Housing and Local Government was urged to extend the grant provisions of the Clean Air Act to provide for the payment of grants towards the cost of adapting grates in dwellings situated in the areas of heavy smoke pollution, even if such houses were not in smoke control areas. The Minister replied that the purpose of the grant was to assist people compelled to change their fireplaces. If grants were payable to people outside smoke control areas the Minister would have to make it conditional on the use of smokeless fuel and he thought this condition would be difficult to enforce. Thames View Estate At the end of the year there were 1,883 dwellings on the Thames View Estate, the tenants of which use smokeless fuel on approved grates fitted with means of gas ignition. The estate is a Smoke Control Area by virtue of tenancy agreements and not under the provisions of the Clean Air Act. There have been no difficulties with regard to thesuppl) of smokeless fuels and no complaints of fume emission from fires. The success of the smoke control measures in this area gives rise to hopes that the whole programme will be carried through without insurmountable difficulties. Industrial Smoke Side by side with the work to reduce domestic smoke pollution the activities to control emissions of smoke from industrial sources has continued. The success of this work depends a great deal on the day to day surveillance of chimneys and other sources. So far as most of the industrial chimneys are concemed Page 66 most of the contraventions of the Clean Air Act are spasmodic and generally found to be due to some unforeseen circumstances, such as a mechanical breakdown or inexperienced supervision of plant. These matters can generally be dealt with by discussions with the management who have been found to be co-operative. In the case of persistent contravention however formal action has to be taken and this was done in the case of excessive emissions from a chimney serving a furnace producing metallic oxide. A prosecution was taken but the case was dismissed on the grounds that a certificate of exemption from the provisions of Section 1 of the Clean Air Act had been issued by the Council as provided for in Section 2 of the Act. The certificate referred to was for a period of six months which had expired eight months before the Court proceedings. At the end of the year steps were being taken by the Company concerned to install an oil fired furnace which should be smokeless in operation. Another prosecution was taken against a firm of scrap metal dealers in respect of excessive smoke emission from an installation used for burning the insulation from scrap cable. In this case a fine of £5 was imposed. One serious source of pollution which gives rise to a number of complaints are the bonfires associated with scrap metal yards where car bodies and scrap cable are burned. Section 16 of the Clean Air Act is the only legislation applicable to this type of pollution. This section deals with smoke other than that from chimneys. In order to succeed, any action under this Section must show that an emission is a nuisance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. This so difficult to establish as to prohibit the use of the Section. It is felt that such emissions should be subject to the same limitations as to colour and density as those for chimneys. Page 67 Smoke Observations In addition to the day to day surveillance of chimneys already referred to, smoke observations of thirty minutes duration were carried out during the year. These resulted in five contraventions being recorded. Warning letters were sent in three cases and the other two were the subject of prosecutions, details of which have been given. There were one third of the number of contraventions recorded in 1958, a probable result of the installation of new plant and instruments being put in hand by a number of factory owners. Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution The measurement of solid deposit and sulphur dioxide pollution of the atmosphere continues to be made. As will be seen from the chart there has again been a reduction in the average soot fall recorded in Barking. From the tables noted on pages 71 and 72 it will be seen that there has been no corresponding reduction in the sulphur dioxide pollution over the years. Work is going on continuously in an effort to discover an economic process of measuring this gas from the flue gases before discharge to the atmosphere. There are processes in use in two London power stations but it costs nearly ten shillings for every ton of coal burned in the furnaces to deal with the sulphur dioxide in the flue gases. All fuels, including oil and smokeless fuels contain sulphur in varying degrees and it may be that the best way to deal with the problem would be to remove the sulphur from the fuel rather than from the flue gases. It has been held that so far as coal is concerned a great reducetion could be effected by cleansing coal properly at the pit head but any method would undoubtedly result in an increas in price. Until advances are made in the field of sulphur efforts must be concentrated on the types of pollution which Page 68 can be dealt with, the solid matter. Not only will this make the air cleaner but it will reduce the ill effects of the sulphur dioxide pollution.

The results of the treatment are set out as follows:- May November Number of manholes baited 412 410 Number showing pre-bait take 95 114 Number showing complete pre-bait take 51 57 PREVALENCE OF RATS AND MICE Type of properties (1) Properties in Area No. of properties in area in which infestation was found Analysis of Col.4 Number infested by (2) Notified by Occupiers (3) Survey under the Act (4) Total RATS MICH Major Minor Local Authority's property 5,340 28 - 28 - 52 55 Dwelling houses 22,236 153 - 153 - 98 132 Business premises 2,160 30 326 356 - 204 152 Totals 211 326 537 - 354 339 74 The method of sewer baiting in the Borough is to employ 1-3-5 form of treatment using sausage rusk with zinc phosphide. We have found in practice this gives us the best results. The same bait is usual for surface treatment using prebaits on three consecutive days with zinc phosphide on the fourth day. Warfarin base is our principal bait in the prevention of mice infestation. It was not necessary to serve any notices under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act. The Council provides a free service for the treatment of any dwelling concerned, but a charge of 7/- per hour is made in respect of commercial and industrial buildings. The Council employs one full time rodent operative. Section G - GENERAL SANITATION STATUTORY NOTICES Default Action In 7 instances it was necessary to report to the Council where owners of properties had not carried out the requirements of notices served within the time specified. The works were carried out by the owners, in each case later, before legal proceedings were instituted. Repairs were carried out by the Corporation at one property in accordance with the provisions of Section 39and 45 of the Public Health Act, 1936, and the cost charged to the owners of the property. 75 Disposal of Radio-active Waste In April it was learned that a local firm engaged in the manufacture of Thorium products was closing down following transfer of the works to another area. A routine check using a survey meter indicated some contamination around the Barking perimeter of the premises. Arising from our result a fuller investigation was carried out by the Radiochemical Inspector of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Further areas of contamination within the factory were discovered, mainly in that part of the factory situated in the Borough of Ilford. Whilst the levels of contamination were not such as to create any risk to the public at large, extensive decontamination measures were commenced and were continuing at the end of the year. Radioactive Substances Bill Whilst the above investigations were in process the Council considered the possible danger to health which night arise from a radio-active episode with the Borough. They expressed anxiety as to their responsibility and invited delegates from neighbouring authority areas to a conference to discuss the matter. A meeting was arranged to take place early in 1960. Examination of Plans The arrangement between the Borough Engineer and ourselves for us to comment on building plans submitted continued throughout the ear - 188 plans were received. This enables co-ordination of requirements to benefit both the Council and the builder. 76 Supply of Dustbins The number of premises where dustbins are supplied and maintained by the Corporation in accordance with Section 75 (3) of the Public Health Act, 1936, was at the end of the year 5,620. The number of dustbins supplied by the Corporation under this arrangement during the year was 414. The total number of properties in the instalment scheme for the provision of dustbins is 865. Therefore, the total number of privately owned premises in the Borough now supplied with standard type of dustbins has reached 6,485. On their Becontree Estate of 8,000 dwellings the London County Council provide a standard type of galvanised iron bin. In accordance with a hire scheme complementary to the above-mentioned, 149 properties were supplied with dustbins. In each of these cases the dustbins will be paid for by eight annual payments of 4/6d. Public Cleansing Refuse Disposal The Borough Engineer has supplied me with the following information:- The quantity of refuse collected and disposed of throughout the year was 79,205 cubic yards, the average weight per cubic yard 5,482 and the total weight 21,703. In February the Borough Engineer reported to the Council on refuse disposal at the Corporation tip at Rippleside Marshes. He stated that we were disposing of 30,000 tons annually at a cost of 4/- per ton. Our present tipping area was sufficient for a further l5 years but this period would be extended to 17/4 years if we carried out pulverisation prior to tipping. The Council supports the proposal for the installing of a Refuse Disposal Pulverising Plant. 77 Disinfestotion of Verminous Premises During the year we received complaints from 18 premises of vermin infestation - bed bugs. Most of the infestations were minor and were resolved by simple treatment. The total premises comprised:- Barking Council Houses 8 London County Council Houses 6 Privately owned 4 18 The Council provide a free disinfestation service. PESTS Flies and Cockroaches We have continued to operate a mobile spraying unit using dispersable gammaxane chiefly for dealing with breeding sites at offensive trade premises, stables, open land, tips, piggeries and stagnant water-courses. We are satisfied that this practice is successful as a preventive measure. There were 151 premises treated. Private Tips at Rippleside An extensive area of low lying land has been filled over a number of years by uncontrolled tipping. This has caused considerable nuisance and occupied your public health inspectors time in supervision. It is pleasing to report that the operations are now completed. 78 The filled land is available for development and warehouse type buildings are being erected by private enterprise. Pet Animals Act, 1951 During the year 16 inspections were made of the eight licensed premises in the Borough. All the premises are satisfactorily complying with the above Act, which requires provision for fire prevention, proper sanitary conditions throughout the premises and suitable housing and feeding facilities for the pet animals kept for sale. OFFENSIVE TRADES The Diseases of Animals (Waste Foods) Order, 1957 The Council, at the request of the Essex County Council, agreed to take over their functions with respect to this Order as from 1st January 1958. Your public health inspectors who already visit the three large piggeries in the Borough, have carried out the duties of inspection and control. Throughout the year there have been 24 visits to the eight offensive trade premises in the Borough. Type of Trade Number Oil Boilers 6 Gut Scraper 18 Oil Boilers There are three groups of products where oil boiling is part of the process of manufacture:- 1. Paint. 2. Printers' Ink. 3. Stand oil and lithographic varnish. 79 The conditions at these factories have been improved by changes in technique. We have occasional incidents due to breakdowns both human and mechanical. Fa! Melting and Gut Scraping Last year I complained that our one long established licensed premises is badly sited owing to redevelopment by industry all around the site. However good the management some odour in the summer is unavoidable. The occupier would readily move out if he could obtain a licence from some other local authority. SWIMMING BATHS AND SWIMMING POOL I am indebted to the Borough Engineer who has supplied with the following figures:- 1957 1958 1959 East Street Baths Total bathers 77,566 86,567 87,152 Parfe Suiimming Pool Total bathers 99,117 73,008 174,217 Slipper Baths Total bathers 39,713 36,623 35,678 Sampling Samples of swimming bath water were taken during the "ear> as follows:- East Street Bath 6 Park Swimming Pool 5 South East Essex Technical College .. 10 80 All the samples submitted to the Borough Analyst werf reported to be of a high standard of bacterial purity. WATER SUPPLY (a) Domestic Water Each month samples from the main supplies were obtained for bacteriological examination and twice during the year for chemical analysis. All were reported to be satisfactory. (b) Industrial Water There have been 15 samples of water obtained from the wells in use at factories, submitted to bacteriological examination. Samples of water from both main and deep wells supply were found to be of a high standard of bacteriological purity. RAINFALL Rain fell during the year on 202 days and measured 13.82 inches compared with 26.44 inches for the previous year. Daily records show that 0.01 inches or more rain fell on 116 days and 0.04 inches or more rain was recorded on 86 days. Printed in the Town Clerk's Department Barking Borough Council
