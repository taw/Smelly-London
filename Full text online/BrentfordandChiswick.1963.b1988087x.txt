Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the 36th Annual Report on the health of the people of Brentford and Chiswick. The year 1963 was a very strange one in that although for almost the first quarter of the year the weather was bitter and hard in a manner which might have been expected to produce illness in a population not accustomed to such severity, living in homes both inadequately heated and insufficiently protected against hard frosts and working very often in ill ventilated and overheated modern office buildings or factories, yet the health pattern in the Borough was good. The Birth Rate rose slightly, the Death Rate fell, the Infant Mortality Rate was not a great deal more than half the average rate for the rest of the country and notifiable infectious disease, apart from an outbreak of mild measles was inconsiderable. Diseases of the heart and circulation gave the highest figures in the causes of deaths list and cancer came second to coronary disease and showed a distinct fall in 1963 from the 1962 figure. Alarms occurred during the year about suspected cases of typhoid and small™ pox coming in from abroad, but no trouble followed any of these incidents. There was rather more evidence of virus diseases occurring, however, a considerable amount of mild influenza in January and February, a number of students infected by a viral form of sickness at one school, and from time to time, cases of infectious hepatitis and glandular fever. None of these viral diseases are compulsorily notifiable and such occurrences are only made known to the Medical Officer of Health by communications from enthusiastic and preventive health minded general practitioners. The inspection of food handling methods and of the premises in which food is handled is a very important part of the work of the Department and although there has been a continuing improvement in the Borough in the conditions of food premises, it is unsatisfactory to find so many contraventions of the Pood Hygiene Regulations in the statistics to be found on page 30/31. Dirty premises and insufficient rat proofing are faults which might result in illness amongst the consumers and cannot be tolerated. It seems that the public is very gradually becoming more sensitive to these matters and complaints reaching the department are dealt with promptly and if necessary by using the full force of the law as can be seen from the number of successful prosecutions undertaken and reported on page 32 The welfare of the elderly continued to occupy the attention of the departmental staff, and there was also an increase in the amount of voluntary work for the elderly undertaken by private citizens during the year. The meals service continued to expand and although another van, bringing the total to three, was brought into service during the year, already at the endof the year it was obvious that a fourth van was becoming urgently necessary. -7- The worst slums of the Borough had been cleared by the end of 196 3 and although there is still some sub-standard property and overcrowding in homes, the steady improvement over the years continues, but housing for the needy, for the aged, for the infirm and for the improvident remains, and will continue to remain, amatter of deep concern to the Medical Officer of Health because of the risks to health and to life itself involved. During the year the Home Safety Sub-Committee discussed many matters re levant to the prevention of home accidents,, and in addition the health education of the public was continuous with regard to safe living, A number of authorities were approached and improvements suggested in building and design of equipment to make households safer. The Smoke Control programme proceeded normally. 697 acres of the Borough were smoke controlled and 165 acres were under Smoke Control Order confirmed but not operative, at the end of 1963. The World Health Organisation suggests as a health indicator for any area, a comparison of the percentage of total deaths at age 50 compared with previous years. The comparison of the Annual Reports of 1913 and 1963 would give a very interesting health indicator of this type, but the statistics in the two urban district Reports of that time do not provide this figure, However, an interest ing comparison can be made between the proportion of persons who did not live beyond the age of 25 in the two years, with half a century between, and also those who died before the age of 65. 1913 1 963 Age Total deaths Age Total deaths Under 1 137 Under 1 14 1 - 5 70 1 5 4 5 - 15 39 5-15 - 15 25 24 15 - 25 2 25 - 65 197 25 - 65 200 Over 65 209 Over 65 459 676 679 It will be seen that in 1913, 40% died under the age of 25 and in 1963 2,9% died under the age of 25, while 69% died under the age of 65 in 1913 and 32% in 1963. The great change in the expectation of life for a child born in Brentford and Chiswick is very clearly visible in these figures. Once again I would like to thank all who have helped with the preparation of this Report by providing information or statistics. My thanks are also due to all the loyal and energetic members of the staff of the Public Health Department to whom the citizens of the Borough owe a great deal, since from day to day they quietly and unostentatiously keep alert and busy to help to maintain good health and hygiene in our district.

There are many types of industrial building from small one man factories to large concerns covering many acres of ground, and producing goods of wide variety, from the small parts required for radio and television,, to perfumes, soaps polishes packet foods and medicinal drinks Many of the factories distribute throughout the world and in two factories large scale packaging of heavy machinery and motor cars for overseas shipment is carried on. There is a considerable amount of new office building in multi-storey blocks which may limit the amount of commuting necessary for citizens of the Borough, An important change was foreshadowed for Brentonians by the announcement that the unsightly buildings of the Brentford Gas Works were gradually to have their use discontinued,, with the subsequent probably long wished for demolition of these. Thus became possible the realization of a dream of the local people that they might walk again on their river frontage, and take ease and recreation by their own river Thames. There are 619.75 acres of open space within the borough with ample facilities for refreshment and recreation both for the public in general and for the sporting activities of particular groups. The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25%, a very reasonable proportion for an urban area. The residents of the Borough are of mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades artisans, factory workers etc., and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds The amount of slum property is not consider -10 able and progress continues to be made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation. Information on the rehousing of the tenants in council houses and details concerning assessment of slum dwellings, demolition and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report. The unemployment figures for adult persons, i. e. aged 18 and over in the Borough at the end of 1963 shows a marked decrease compared with the previous year. At the end of 1963 there were 258 unemployed, of which 227 were men and 31 women, At the end of 1962 the total unemployed numbered 329 and the previous year 266, With regard to vacancies there was an increased demand for labour. On 4th December, 1963, the number of vacancies outstanding was 468 (of which 246 were for men and 222 for women) compared with 248 in December, 1962 and 331 in December, 1961. Generally therefore the demand for labour was greater than the supply, particularly with regard to skilled work. The unemployment figures at the end of 1963 of young persons under 18 years of age were as follows - Boy s Girls Total Number of young persons (other than school leavers) registered as unemployed on 31 12 63 11 7 18 Boys and Girls who left school at Christmas to enter employment 9 23 32 Totals 20 30 50 Vacancies outstanding at 31 12 63 56 123 179 During the early part of the year the severe weather conditions were responsible for some short-time working and temporary stoppages, Some young people who left their employment without having another job to start, experienced delay and difficulty and often found themselves no better off. The position eased to some extent as the weather improved, and although the Easter School Leavers were not absorbed into employment very quickly, the local picture was much brighter than the national one, The engineering industry took some time to recover and boys who were interested in this industry sometimes had to take a second or third choice of occupation, Progressive vacancies were particularly difficult to obtain in the printing and woodwork trades for boys, while there were few local vacancies for junior shorthand typists unless they could offer good working speeds There was also a good deal of competition for junior vacancies leading to Drawing Office work. It was found that employers were generally able to be even more selective than in previous years, Fortunately, local employers responded well to an early appeal for vacancies for the summer term school leavers and there were sufficient openings for everyone, although several had to undertake temporary jobs rather than be unemployed whilst awaiting a particular vacancy. There were very few young people available for employment at Christmas as a result of the change in the school leaving dates. There were no statutory leavers for the first time, and only those who had remained at school beyond the statutory age were permitted to leave, 11 Parks and Open Spaces Controlled by the Council Area in Acres Boston Manor Park and Island 36.7 Carville Hall Park South 4.7 Carville Hall Park North 9.1 St. Paul' s Recreation Ground 4.3 Chiswiek Common South 8.7 Chiswick House 66.8 Stamford Brook Common 2.1 Homefields Recreation Ground 10.3 Strand Open Space 2.6 Turnham Green Common 7.5 Duke s Meadows Sports Ground 25.7 Embankment Promenade 9.1 Future Embankment Promenade 15.3 Chiswiek Open Air Pools Site 1.2 10.4 acres of the above open space land are used as allotments.

Capacity 12,049 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1963 64.569 Average number per day 184 Maximum number using baths on one day 492 Chiswick Open Air Swimming Pools:- Large Pool Area 7,500 sq.ft. Capacity 33,750 c. ft Snail Pool Area 3 500 sq.ft. Capacity 18,375 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1963 69,465 Average number per day 466 Maximum number using baths on one day 2 932 The variation in figures from year to year is a very clear indication of the type of summer weather. The year was cold, wet and dull as was the previous year and the figures for the indoor bath increased in each of the years over those for 1961 by almost the same number as those for the Open Air Pools fell the total for the two being nearly the same in 1961, 1962 and 1963, This is quite interesting since the two places are over two miles apart. The source of the water in the swimming baths was the mains supply of the Metropolitan Water Board, In both the indoor bath and the outdoor pools the water went through a continuous filtration process, the rate of change-over being about once every three hours in the indoor bath, about once every eight hours in the large open air pool and once every six hours in the smaller open air pool. Topping up to allow for loss by evaporation or removal was done several times weekly. Additional purification was carried out by means of intermittent chlorination, the amount of free chloride aimed at being 0.6 parts per million Water samples were taken two to three times daily throughout the season for the purposes of chemical analysis and pH estimation. Water sampling was carried out frequently from both Brentford and Chiswick Baths, Brentford gave excellent results except at the very start of the season but results were bad for the Chiswick Pools after every crowded occasion throughout the summer and chlorination had to be increased greatly. To keep down growth of algae, "Panacide" continued to be used during the first part of the summer season in the Chiswick Pools, but the use of this sub stance was discontinued after the middle of July, as there was no simple way of testing the concentration of Panacide in the water, and when over dosage occurred the green deposit from the substance made the water as cloudy as algae would have done, so its purpose was not being achieved. A scheme for the introduction of break point chlorination equipment was put in hand to be installed during the winter to be ready for use in the summer of 1964, Paddling Pools Duke s Meadows:- Area (2 pools each 60' x 60 ) 7,200 sq. ft. Depth 6" to 1' in middle These paddling pools are emptied and refilled daily from the mains supply and ½ Pint Chloros is added at each filling, -13- They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year, according to weather conditions. Public Baths and Washhooses Brentford In Clifden Road, Brentford, the Council maintains premises containing 21 slipper baths, 14 for men, and 7 for women. The total number using the baths during 1963 was 16,908 persons. Chiswick In Belmont Road, Chiswick, the Council maintains premises containing 31 slipper baths, 22 for men, and 9 for women. In addition, 2hip baths are available particularly for the use of elderly persons. The total number using the baths during 1963 was 39,808. In these premises are also 18 washing compartments comprising 18 coppers, a rinsing section (4 hydro extractors), 30 drying horses, hot air drying compartments and 2 mangling machines. Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour, and during 1963, 1,219 persons took advantage of the service. -14- VITAL STATISTICS, 196 3 Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 932 472 460 Birth Rate per 1,000 of Illegitimate 112 54 58 the estimated resident TOTAL 1, 044 526 518 population - 18.92 Stillbirths Total Male Female Legitimate 10 9 1 Rate per 1, 000 total Illegitimate 4 2 2 (live and still) Births TOTAL 14 11 3 - 13. 23 Deaths Total Male Female 679 320 359 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 12, 31 Deaths of Infants under 1 Year of Age Total Male Female Legitimate 14 10 4 Rate per 1,000 live Illegitimate - - - Births - 13. 41 TOTAL 14 10 4 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis Rate per 1,000 total Other Puerperal Causes (live and still) Births - Nil -15- Deaths and Death Rate The death rate fell from 12.45 in 1962 to 12. 31 in 1963. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar General. In 1963, this factor was 1.00 and so the corrected death rate was the same as the crude death rate, i. e. 12. 31. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 12.2, a little lower than that for Brentford and Chiswick, Table I gives a list of Causes of Death as classified according to the International system agreed by the World Health Organisation. The principal causes of death were:- 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 195 7 1956 Circulatory Disease (including coronary disease) 259 245 218 215 201 222 215 224 Heart Disease 82 76 73 84 76 99 82 91 Cancer (including Leukaemia) 139 155 134 126 123 130 135 153 Cancer was no longer the chief cause of death in 1963, as it had been for some years, Coronary disease gave the highest figure - 157 deaths, and cancer was second greatest with 139.

These included 4 road accidents, 11 suicides (six from gas poisoning, five from drug poisoning) and 13 other accidents. The number of accidental deaths rose from 11 in 1962 to 13 in 1963 and the details of these are in the following table. All of the victims are aged over 60 except four, and the two main causes appear this time to be falls at home, and poisoning by drugs. = 17- Female 43 Drug 70 Pall at home 60 Drugs 82 Pall at home 34Burns 83 Fall at home 82 Fall at home 36 Drugs (addict) Male 87 Gas poisoning 32 Crushed by falling object 67 Fall at home 70 Drugs 75 Fall at home. Comparative figures from deaths from violent causes over the last 10 years are as follows:- 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 28 27 22 32 26 23 23 26 27 27 Four residents died through involvement in road accidents. The ages of these cases were: - Males:18, 33, 61 Femaless:79 One of these died as a result of an accident within the Borough, a pedal cyclist (aged 61). In all, four persons, including residents of other places, died as a result of road accidents occurring in Brentford and Chiswick; one motor cyclist, one motor car passenger, one pedal cyclist and one pedestrian. None of these were children. The number who died as a result of road accidents within the Borough in 1961 was 15, and in 1962 it was 9, so over these two last years there has been a steady improvement. But although the deaths were fewer, the number injured to a greater. or lesser degree was greatly increased i.e. 578 persons were killed, or injured, in road accidents on Brentford and Chiswick roads during 1963, compared with 482 in 1962, 534 in 1961, and 512 in 1960. Birth Rate During 1963, the number of live births recorded was 1,044, 932 legitimate and 112 illegitimate. There were 14 still-births, 11 male and 3 female. The Birth Rate rose again from 18.41 in 1962 to 18.92 in 1963. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This then gives a comparative birth rate of 17.41 compared with 18 2 for England and Wales as a whole. INFANT MORTALITY There were 14 deaths of infants under 1 year of age, giving an infant mortality rate of 13.41 for 1963. The local figure compares with an infant mortality rate of 20.9 for England and Wales and is far below this and the Middlesex County figure, the latter figure being 18.7. 18 The graph on page 20 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century The number of premature infants born in 1963 was 69 (63 in 1962) including 5 premature stillbirths. Of the 64 premature infants born alive, 7 were born at home: all were surviving at the end of one month 57 were born in hospital, of whom 53 survived to the end of one month. The percentage of premature infant births to total births (live and still) was 6 5 compared with 6 1 in 1962. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis Nil Other Causes Nil During the year, 58 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified as compared with 72 in 196 2, No case occurred after home confinement, all were notified from Chiswick Maternity Hospital. 6 of the cases were residents of the Borough. In addition one Chiswick resident developed Sonne dysentery while in Queen Charlotte's Hospital as a maternity case. The definition of puerperal pyrexia for notification purposes is 'any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100 4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after child-birth or miscarriage". 19 The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1953, 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 4.9 6.0 6.9 6.4 8.4 7.3 6.6 8.1 8.0 6.1 6.5 Causes of infant deaths are shown in Table II on page 76 GRAPH "A" GRAPH SHOWING INFANTILE MORTALITY RATES DURING THE PERIOD 1900 - 1963 Brentford U.D.

D. • Year of Amalgamation 20 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES CONTROL OF VERMIN AND SCABIES By the courtesy of the School Medical Officer particulars regarding the cleanliness surveys in schools have been obtained, and are as follows Number of children examined Primary Schools 7,737 Secondary Modern Schools 2,700 10,437 Number of children requiring treatment 48 Number of children in respect of whom cleansing notices were issued 38 Number of children cleansed by Local Health Authority 22 For detail see Table XI on page 84. The figures for infestation with vermin improved slightly during 1963. By arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health of Hammersmith, persons requiring cleansing because of infestation with scabies or vermin can be treated at the Hammersmith Cleansing Station,, During 1963, 6 persons were referred for cleansing from scabies. INFECTIOUS DISEASE In the year 1963 the amount of infectious disease notified increased mainly due to the biennial occurrence of measles. There was a rise in the figure for notifications of food poisoning, but only one of these was subsequently confirmed bacteriologically and another confirmed as Sonne Dysentery, Several cases of ophthalmia neonatorum were notified, mainly as a result of a request that the statutory notification requirement be observed, i.e. the occurrence of a sticky eye in a new born infant within 21 days of birth. So many children from hospital appear at clinics affected in this way, that it is obvious that the notification requirement is not being observed. Measles 21 The following figures of measles notifications show the fluctuations of this disease during the past ten years 19 54 1955 1956 1957 1958 19 59 1960 1961 196 2 1963 47 659 107 773 330 328 47 542 38 334 Poliomyelitis No notifications of anterior poliomyelitis were received during the year. The Scheme for inoculation against poliomyelitis inaugurated by Middlesex County Health Department in 1956, continued during 1963. Details of the years work are as follows- No of persons who received 3 doses of oral vaccine Born in the following years 1963 1962 1961 1943-1960 1933-1942 Others Tota1 107 430 83 94 56 32 802 No, of persons who received 2 injections Born in the following years 1963 1962 1961 1943.1960 1933.1942 Others Total 2 17 9 9 11 18 66 No, of persons who received 3 injections Born in the following years 1963 1962 1961 194 3-1960 1933-1942 Others Total - 8 26 21 24 36 115 41 primary school children received a fourth injection during the year. 121 primary school children received an oral boost after 3 injections. No of persons given an oral boost after 2 injections Born in the following years 1962 1961 1943-1960 1933-1942 Others Total 4 64 23 12 10 113 The use of the Sabin method of vaccination, i. e. vaccine given by mouth instead of by injection, begun in the County Clinics early in the year 1962,was rapidly developed as the method of choice, and by the end of the year, the giving of Salk vaccine by injection had ceased in the clinics. Certain general practi tioners in the Borough however, have continued to use this method. Puerperal Pyrexia The number of notifications of puerperal pyrexia was 58 in 1963 compared with 72 in 1962, These puerperal pyrexia cases were mostly mild and notified under the statutory requirement to notify any temperature rise to over 100° in the immediate post-natal period after confinement, but eleven were more serious cases including four of pyelo-nephritis, three of pneumonia after Caesarean section one of retained placenta, one of abscess of leg, and two of bronchitis. = 22- Smallpox Only two persons arriving unvaccinated from the Middle East where smallpox is endemic were notified to the Public Health Department during the year. They were kept under observation until the incubation period of the disease had elapsed. One other contact of a suspected case was notified, but the case subsequently was not confirmed as smallpox. Vaccination against Smallpox The following information regarding vaccination against smallpox carried out in the Borough during 1963 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer. Number of persons who during the year were Age Groups Total Under 1 l 2-4 5-14 15 & over vaccinated for first time 71 137 18 12 13 251 re-vaccinated - 1 2 3 51 57 Total 71 138 20 15 64 308 Total number of first vaccinations 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 548 487 438 418 430 531 525 455 584 2, 192 251 These figures are the lowest for years, and show very clearly the influence of fear on the population. There was no newspaper report of smallpox in 1963. so vaccination was neglected., yet the risk was no greater and no less in either year. In both years, persons from infectious areas entered the Borough and might have developed the illness, but did not. Vaccination of persons intending to travel abroad has to be confirmed by the vaccinating doctor on an International Certificate of Vaccination which is not acceptable unless the signature is authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. During 1963 643 such Certificates were authenticated, compared with 2,681 in 1962. Scarlet Fever There was again a fall in the number of cases of scarlet fever notified and confirmed as such, the figure being 16 in 1963 compared with 18 in 1962 and 23 in 1961, 5 of these cases were admitted to hospital, Three of the cases occurred at the same time in one household, but there were no secondary cases during the year. Whooping Cough Seven cases of whooping cough occurred in 1963, four being sufficiently severe as to require hospital admission. Immunisation against whooping cough is fairly general now, the inoculation being carried out either simultaneously with that for immunisation against diphtheria, or in series alternating with anti-diphtheria inoculation and outbreaks of whooping cough have not been occurring during the past few years. No deaths occurred from this disease during 1963. 23 Diphtheria No case of diphtheria occurred during the year. The last confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough occurred in 1948, Information concerning immunisation against diphtheria in the Borough during 1963 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer,, and is as follows - Number of children who Age Total Under 1 l 2-4 5 14 completed a full course of primary immunisation 262 329 58 383 1, 032 (182) (260) (25) (34) (501) received reinforcing injections 187 142 287 616 (3) (182) (127) (180) (492) (Figures for 1962 are shown in brackets ) These figures are much more satisfactory in 1963 the use of a Triple Vaccine - Diphtheria Pertussis and Tetanus seems to bring in the mothers of young infants better as this combined with a substitution of oral for injected poliomyelitis vaccine greatly lessens the number of injections required. Food Poisoning Forty-three notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. One case was confirmed bacteriologically one was confirmed as Sonne Dysentery and the remaining 41 were not confirmed. In November complaints were received that a number of scholars attending Chiswick Polytechnic were suffering from abdominal symptoms - food poisoning was suspected The premises were visited inspected and the canteen methods and production overhauled Specimens were taken of water, milk tea coffee detergent throat swabs faeces specimens and a specimen from a hand wound were taken and submitted for investigation all proved negative for infectious organisms. A doctor of the staff of the Ministry of Health and a doctor of the Medical Research Council were kind enough to come over to assist with the investigations and it was eventually decided that the condition had been one of virus origin Although the number of people affected amounted to 154 (students and staff) there was no prolonged sickness and no complications were reported. The occurrence disturbed the school programme considerably, but the headmaster and staff were very helpful. Certain improvements in the methods of preparing, handling and serving of food, and in the system of dish washing and waste food disposal were suggested to Middlesex County Council. Dysentery Four notifications of dysentery were received. None were confirmed bacteriologically. One case notified as food poisoning was subsequently confirmed as a case of Sonne dysentery. One case notified as Sonne dysentery to another authority of a boarding school boy whose home was in Chiswick, was clear on his return to the Borough. 24 Influenza Influenza occurred to a fairly considerable extent in the early part of the year of sufficient severity to result in overcrowding of the local general hospitals but no deaths were attributed directly to this cause Typhoid In March notification was received from the Ministry of Health that cases of typhoid fever were occurring in this country from an infection which had developed in Zermatt in Switzerland. We were asked to check our local food handlers to find if any had visited Switzerland during the early part of the year and a circular letter was sent to managers of food shops cafes, public houses, factory canteens water undertakings 150 stallholders in Brentford Market, proprietors of food factories the School Meals Organisers the street traders general practitioners and hospital superintendents, No person was discovered,. However, one confirmed case of typhoid fever was notified an air hostess who had stayed in Zermatt She was treated in hospital and discharged cured Only two contacts of Zermatt cases were discovered, but no illness deve loped. A case of paratyphoid fever also occurred during the year, No source of infection was traceable locally and it was presumed that the patient was in fected in London He was treated in hospital and discharged cured, Tuberculosis The number of notifications of tuberculosis in 1963 was 47 as compared with 51 in the previous year the pulmonary cases amounting to 41 and the non pulmonary to 6 The number of deaths from this disease was four as compared with five in 1962, and one in 1961. The figure of 47 notifications includes 14 inward transfers i,e, cases notified because they had removed into the Borough but who had previously con" tracted the disease elsewhere This leaves a total of 33 new cases of tuber culosis occurring within the borough compared with the figure of 29 new cases in 1962 Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care were provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic., and home visiting was carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic. They were also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B.C.G. inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis B C G inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative, i e susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases 53 children from Brentford and Chiswick were given B C„ G. at the Chest Clinic in 1963. A prominent part in the treatment was played by domiciliary chemo therapy (i.e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recom mendation of the Chest Physician with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council, Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Management Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in General Hospitals and in Chest Hospitals a Middlesex County Council Hostel was available for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients 25 Facilities for convalescence, rehabilitation and training were provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis was dealt with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic. B. C. G. Vaccination As a result of the findings from the Tuberculosis Vaccinations Clinical Trial, which took place from 1950 to I960, that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B.C.G., a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and, if neces sary, vaccination of school children at the age of 13. During 1963, 687 children were invited to take part in the scheme 491 consents were received. These children were tuberculin tested and those found to be positive indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of a minor or major degree at some period in their lives, were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation. 135 positives were so referred, B.C.G. vaccination was carried out on 272child ren. Ten contacts of cases of tuberculosis were referred to the Chest Clinic. All tests and vaccinations during 1963 under this scheme were carried out by Middlesex County Council staff, HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1963 The housing conditions of 39 of the 47 cases of tuberculosis notified during the year were found to be as follows - 35 patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, (15 in flats 6 in houses 14 in lodgings or furnished rooms) but in one case the property was old dilapidated and subject to dampness in another the patient was living in overcrowded conditions and two others were living in houses in multiple occupation The housing particulars of eight cases were not obtained because of re moval from the district or in two cases the death of the patient. Seven new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis in five instances the new patient was the second case in the household in two others the new patient was the third to occur in the family. 14 cases were inward transfers from other districts and therefore had not developed their illness while resident in Brentford and Chiswick, Of the two families previously reported in 1962 one was living in old property subject to dampness and has removed to good Council accommodation and one was in overcrowded housing and this overcrowding has been abated Mass X Ray Work done by Mass X ray Unit 5A in the Borough during the year consisted only of short visits to the factories and offices listed below One active case of pulmonary tuberculosis and one of lung cancer were discovered in Brentford and Chiswick residents and one of pulmonary tuberculosis two of lung cancer and four cases for observation were found in addition amongst workers not resident in the Borough out of a total of 4 565 persons X-rayed. 26 Number X-rayed G, Wimpey & Co.

It is particularly useful to the Public Health Department for the obtaining of quick reports on candidates for employment on the Borough Council staff. 27 GRAPH "B" GRAPH OF CASES NOTIFIED AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE PERIOD 1943 - 1963 YEAR Notified Cases of Tuberculosis Deaths from Tuberculosis 28 FOOD CONTROL Work on the observation ana improvement of hygienic reception storage, and sale of food continued throughout the year. There were no prosecutions required because of failure to comply with the Pood Hygiene (General) Regulations, The number of articles brought to the notice of the staff of the Public Health Department because of suspected unfitness for human consumption or because of being in some respect not of the nature, substance, or quality demanded, was very much higher than in 1962 and legal action was necessary in a greater number of cases. This shows that more people are becoming conscious of the usefulness of the Public Health Department if dirty food or food which is diseased or in other ways faulty is sold to them Details can be found on page 32. Observations of the management of food handling preparation and vending continued in canteens shops public houses and food shops and considerable attention was paid to hawkers of food market food stalls and ice cream vendors Although there are still food premises which need much visiting and attention. many of the local traders go far beyond the requirements of the Pood and Drugs Act in their sanitary provisions. Mobile traders are required to provide themselves with suitable washing facilities under the Pood and Drugs Act 1955 and their vehicles require to be checked from time to time. NUMBER AND TYPE OF FOOD PREMISES IN THE BOROUGH Bakers and Confectioners 19 Butchers 39 Club Canteens 10 Confectioners (Sweets) 87 Cafes, Restaurants Dining Rooms and Snack Bars 67 Factory and Staff Canteens 72 Fishmongers 15 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 42 Grocers and Provisions and General Stores 108 Ice Cream Manufacturers 1 Public Houses and Off Licences 82 School Canteens 16 Total 558 ICE CREAM The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc ) Regulations 1959 Throughout the year routine visits were paid to the one ice cream manu facturing premises situated within the Borough for the purpose of taking samples of ice cream ice cream lollies etc for analysis. In addition, samples were taken from suppliers of ice cream etc., manufactured in premises not within the Borough Stricter observation had to be made because of the suddenly increasing production and sale of soft ice cream i.e. heat treated and aerated and served from refrigerated containers instead of individual wrappings. The laboratory was not able to carry out work on more than one day in any week so it was necessary for a refrigerator to be obtained for the Department in order that sampling could continue as and when required, 29 Periodic checks of the recording and indicating thermometers on the manufacturing apparatus were made andthesewere at all times found to satisfy the requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations. Sampling During the year, 142 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and the results obtained are as under:- Grade Ice Cream Ice Lollies factory Doubtful Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatis factory I 30 - - 2 - - II 77 = - - - - III - 12 - - - - IV - - 21 - - - Totals 107 12 21 2 - - These figures show deterioration on those for the previous year, 21 unsatisfactory samples being found compared with 8 in 1962. The above table has been compiled from results graded according to the following provisional grades set up by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, in relation to ice cream testing - Grade Classification Bacterial Count I Below 500 II 500 - 20,000 III 20,000 - 100,000 IV If count is over 100,000 and/or Faecal Coli present FOOD AND DRUGS ACT 1955 Registration of Premises The total number of premises registered in accordance with Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was - Manufacture, sale or storage of ice cream 154 Manufacture and/or preparation of preserved foods 41 FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS 1955 273 contraventions of the above-named Regulations were found and 96 remedied during 1963. Details of these contraventions are as follows:- Contravention Found Remedied Articles/Equipment not kept clean 5 4 Articles/Equipment not in good order 5 - 30 Contravention Found Remedied Containers not protected from contamination 20 4 Food so placed as to involve risk of contamination 8 3 Food placed within 18" of ground and not adequately protected 1 - Water closets not kept clean and in efficient order 18 9 Insufficient lighting and ventilation to water closets 30 4 Absence of "Wash your Hands" Notices in water closets 2 - Inadequate cold water supply 2 - Absence of suitable and sufficient wash hand basins 17 5 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over wash hand basins 21 7 Absence of soap nail brushes clean towels, etc. near wash hand basins 2 2 Absence of or inadequate first aid materials 6 3 Absence of accommodation for clothing not worn during working hours 4 2 Absence of suitable and sufficient sinks for the washing of food and equipment 4 2 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over sink 10 2 Absence of suitable and sufficient ventilation in food rooms 3 - Walls, floors ceilings,, etc. not kept clean 48 22 Walls, floors ceilings, etc. not kept in good order 9 4 Covered receptacle for refuse not provided 9 3 Accumulations of refuse etc. 6 6 Specified foods not stored at prescribed temperature - 1 Miscellaneous 1 1 Defective structure 2 3 Inadequate or defective waste, rainwater and soil drainage 4 - Untrapped sinks etc. 2 - Rat proofing required 33 9 Mobile Vans - condition of 1 - Totals 273 96 No prosecutions were undertaken for contravention of these Regulations. The amount of the defects found in food shops and catering establishments year after year is not a very good indication of the hygiene consciousness of the owners or of the users. Visits have to be paid and penalties threatened to get the most elementary rules of hygiene obeyed, and these figures are a sad indication of the bad conditions that will be discovered when the work on the Offices Shops and Railway Premises Act gets really into operation. Dirty and insanitary food premises are breeding grounds for infection, and those premises found to require rat proofing are offering harbourage and food to immigrant rats, and high figures for this have been found in two successive years 33 requiring rat proofing in 1963, and 27 in 1962 out of just over 500 food establishments in the Borough. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS 91 visits were made to catering establishments during the year and in 57 cases it was necessary to give written or verbal intimation that work was re quired. FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year 38 cases concerning food alleged to be unsound were received in the Department 31 26 cases were substantiated the details of which are as follows:- Complaint Action Taken Match in carton of milk No action. Mould on processed cheese Warning letter. Nail in sliced wrapped loaf No action. String in sliced bridge roll Court action - £25 fine and £8.10s. 0d. costs. Cement in milk bottle Warning letter.

Cap in 1/3 pint bottle of milk Warning letter. Mould on madeira cake Warning letter. Smell of 1/3 pint bottle of orange drink Warning letter. Condition of cooked cod roes (decomposing) Warning letter. There has been a considerable rise in the number of food samples brought to the Department by purchasers. This may indicate more awareness on the part of the public that food should be clean and fresh, or it may indicate, as the figures for Contraventions of the Pood Hygiene Regulations on page 30 suggest that slovenly and dirty sellers and handlers of food are increasing in the Borough, In 1963, there was a record number of prosecutions of sellers or makers of unsound food,, all successful except one for lack of evidence. FOOD SAMPLING By the courtesy of the Chief Officer, Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, the following details of food sampling within the Borough are available:- Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk 9 2 Butter 21 - Cheeses 3 1 Condiments 9 - Cream 12 - Drugs 3 - 32 Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Fish 8 - Fruit 13 - Ice Cream 19 - Liver 9 - Margarine 2 - Meat Paste 4 - Minced Meats 37 2 Sausages 4 - Spirits 3 - Steak and Kidney 8 Miscellaneous 20 - Totals 184 5 The total number of samples taken was fewer in 1963, i.e. 184 in 1963 com pared with 220 in 1962, The number of unsatisfactory samples decreased from 9 in 1962 to 5 in 1963, In fringements Milk contained added water. Court action taken fine £10 in each case. Cheese wrong description Letter of caution sent Minced Meats contained preservative, Letters of caution sent. MEAT AND OTHER FOODS There are now no slaughterhouses operating in Brentford and Chiswick, FOOD CONDEMNED DURING THE YEAR 1963 Fruit and Vegetables 27¼ tons Meat and Bacon 7 cwts Frozen Foods (defrosted) 1,362 pkts Tinned Foods 2,854 tins Fish 9½ stone Cheese 28 lbs, Unsound food is disposed of by incineration tipping or for animal feeding, MILK From 1st January 1961, all licences for milk dealers were required to be issued by the Food and Drugs Authority i,e, Middlesex County Council, Registration of milk distributors is still carried out by the Public Health Department At the end of 1963, there were 71 such premises registered, BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 7 BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit, vegetables and flowers It covers an area of approximately 11 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council. The Corporation employs a staff of 18 at the market and there are approximately 450 holdings with 142 tenants. On busy days roughly 1 500 vehicles pass through the Market. 33 Sanitary conveniences have been provided on the North, West and East sides of the market and some washing facilities are available at these conveniences. The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation employs the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the Market every six weeks to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation, Situated in the Market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries: tinned foods, etc , and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption 34 HEALTH EDUCATION As can be seen from various parts of this Report there is no reduction in the need for continuous Health Education and this is part of the daily life of every public health officer to teach about the good life the healthy body the dangers of carelessness about personal hygiene Excuses made in the past for lack of cleanliness can seldom be justified in these days when houses shops factories restaurants schools are all equipped with running water and soap is a cheap commodity The will to be clean is however apparently a painfully acquired and readily discarded attribute of human beings fastidiousness is not part of the genetic set up as it is in other animals and so the positive ad vantages of cleanliness to a person must be taught and repeated in order to obtain safety for the community People are also selfish in that if infection is caught the cry is Why did someone have to infect me? Yet the same people will knowingly go abroad amongst their friends neighbours and workmates while convalescent from an infectious illness yet not germ free We have to educate constantly on moral and social consciousness yet it is a hard task and the difficulty is revealed at a time when epidemic disease enters the country and is publicized in newspapers or on television Then panic sets in and there is loud and insistent demand for protection and avoidance of areas of incidence in fact the reaction is almost mediaeval in its intensity This has happened in the past few years when deaths from poliomyelitis occurred when deaths from smallpox occurred and when typhoid outbreaks occurred yet everyone could be constantly immune from poliomyelitis and smallpox and everyone could invariably wash his hands before eating The chief topics of the year in Health Education by poster and leaflet publicity have been the dangers of smoking various aspects of Home safety and Food Hygiene At the beginning of the year the Central Council for Health Educa tion held a Seminar for Medical Officers on the subject of New Horizons in Health Education In reality this Seminar was principally used for discussions and demonstrations of modern techniques in education on health and the potential of closed circuit television as a teacher Certain local authorities are al ready using this very successfully in various parts of the country using public health material and staff but professional script writers and producers 35 WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1963 26 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. During the year an Order under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act 1948, was obtained for the compulsory removal to an Old People s Home of an old lady in grave need of care and attention who was refusing to go of her own accord, but the patient finally went willingly and freely Details of the 26 cases are as follows Removed to hospital 5 Removed to Old People' s Home 3 Remained at home (a) Home Help provided 1 (b) Home Help and Home Nurse provided 4 (c) Home Help and Visitor provided 1 (d) Home Help Home Nurse and Laundry Service provided 1 (e) Home Help meals and fuel provided 2 (f) Nurse provided 1 (g) Meals provided 1 (h) Meals provided and awaiting Old People3 s Housing 1 (i) Awaiting Old People s Housing 3 (j) Visitor provided all other help refused 1 (k) All help refused 1 (1) No action 1 During the year a total of 368 aged persons or aged chronic sick persons in the Borough received help from the Home Help Service, and the Home Nurses dealt with 514 old people out of a total of 751 cases. These figures compare with 377 aged persons receiving help from the Home Help Service in 1962 and 483 old persons being visited by the Nurses out of a total of 783 Information supplied by the County Welfare Officer shows that during the year 38 old people from the Borough were admitted to Old People s Homes through the County Welfare Department including six persons previously brought to our notice (two in 1960 one in 1962 and three in 1963) and three persons from onr Meals on Wheels Service recipients One of the 1960 cases unfortunately did not wish to remain returned home and continues to be a problem from time to time The County Council has the duty under the National Assistance Act, 1948 of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them and it does this by admission to its own Homes or by meeting the cost of maintenance in Homes administered by registered Voluntary Organisations. The County Council s Wei fare Department is responsible for the County Homes and one such Home (known as Belfairs in Grove Park Gardens) is situated in the Borough During 1962 it was decided to broaden the scope of departmental enquiries into the needs of elderly people Instead of awaiting a call for action when distress was very great a friendly visit by the Council s Welfare Officer to persons receiving the Meals on Wheels Service was to be made and an enquiry 36 form discreetly completed Any needs ascertained were to be supplied if possible through the various voluntary and statutory agencies and arrangements made for intermittent or regular visiting by suitable persons if the need for this was brought out This service continued during 1963 and the amount of regular visiting which could be arranged if found to be wanted or needed was greatly increased as a result of the Mayor s Appeal for more voluntary workers prepared to do regular visiting to one or more homes 141 persons in receipt of meals during the year were visited by the Welfare Officer and their reports have been summarized 59 expressed themselves pleased to have the meals and were fully satisfied with them in every respect 13 had comments to make on individual items of food but these tended to cancel out i.e too much rice versus more milk puddings less meat versus more stews and seemed to be the result of personal fads rather than dislike of the meals which indeed are cooked at Acton Council premises and are of very good quality The chief difficulty with meals is that it is not possible to provide individual diets for those unable to digest normal food and it is hoped that the provision of delicate tempting meals for the invalid elderly and indeed for invalids of any age who live alone or in conditions where they can become undernourished because of their inability to obtain balanced but delicate meals will be kept clearly in mind by all Welfare authorities Ascertained

or free of charge The number of persons treated in this scheme was 99 in 1963 a decrease from 104 treated during the previous year The County Council Clinic Service held at the Brentford Clinic and the Chiswick Clinic expanded during the year and 272 persons had treatment there compared with 199 in 1962 The total number of Clinic attendances was 1 029 for the year A service is available to make

paid for by the members of the Association themselves Visiting of sick members is undertaken by officers and members of this club Other Societies Several of the societies whose functions are classified elsewhere in this report contribute to a very considerable extent to the Welfare of the Elderly, i e the British Red Cross Association the St John Ambulance Brigade, the 38 Blind Club the Club for the Hard of Hearing the two Philanthropic Societies and the Chiswick Mission The Brentford Philanthropic Society owns a home Scott Lodge for eleven elderly persons and now has under consideration a scheme for an extension to provide an additional nine flatlets The Chiswick Mission owns two houses which are let to aged persons the number of tenants is eight, and the tenants, each of whom has one room pay a small nominal rent Money is available for relief of distress, provided from the Brentford and Chiswick sick Poor Persons Fund During 1963 thirty persons were given assist ance by provision of fuel, bedding clothing or other essentials Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at reduced rates (Id per bath with soap and towel) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments 2 077 baths were taken in Chiswick and 1,470 in Brentford Meals on Wheels The provision of a hot dinner once a day for an old person living alone may make all the difference between health and malnutrition The Meals on wheels Service operated by the Brentford and Chiswick Welfare Organisation continued to expand during 1963 A third van was brought into service in 1963, and this relieved the waiting list so that for a short time the vans were not working above capacity but the numbers of meals recipients continued to rise, soon these vans were overloaded and the need for a fourth van became apparent During the year the Welfare Organisation was disbanded and the Borough Council set up a Welfare Committee to control the existing Welfare services and expand where necessary The number of meals rose from 26,874 supplied to 204 elderly persons in 1962 to 31,203 supplied to 238 persons in 1963 Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged, was carried on throughout the year Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff from various sources, then arrangements were made for the Department s van to call each week to collect the soiled linen deliver it to the laundry, and to transport the clean linen back again to the home of the old person No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health committee During the year fifteen old persons had been recommended for and obtained this service Holidays for the Elderly In May 1963 40 elderly persons were provided (by the Brentford and Chiswick Welfare Organisation) with a free holiday for one week Holidays for elderly persons were also provided by other local organisations viz the two Philanthropic Societies and Chiswick Mission Home Safety The difficulty in obtaining statistics with regard to the occurrence of accidents in the home is considerable Some knowledge of the types of accident most likely to occur can be assessed from the deaths returns but as this is a 39 small number, fortunately, for our district, and as we know that large numbers of people have to be treated by their private doctors and in hospitals following home accidents, it was thought that a useful survey might be undertaken as a guide for future action, in education, in obtaining improvements in house construction and in furniture and equipment manufacture, on better fire precautions, and other relevant matters, if home accidents could be made notifiable in the same way as infectious diseases The Home safety Sub-Committee agreed to pay for such notifications by doctors and hospitals in the same way as are infectious disease notifications but at the end of the year no information was coming in, so the Survey had to be postponed and Home Safety Education continued on the lines outlined in various national campaigns on particular subjects which were organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents The gradual elimination of dangerous oil heaters, an increase in the sale of flame prorf underwear and nightwear for children the manufacture of panguards for the tops of cookers, the improvements of taps on gas cookers and gas pokers were all useful in reducing the risks of home accident and the provision of guard rails for baths and in old people s halls and doorways were gradually becoming more accepted as routine planning Many old houses in the Borough had steep circular stairs with no handrails and no light, and they are gradually being demolished and replaced by safer modern dwellings The North Thames Gas Board who in 1956 offered a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone, continued to arrange for inspections during the year The reason for this was in order to reduce the risk of gas poisoning , a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people The offer was to include replacement of faulty pipes and the repair of faulty appliances these services being given free if circumstances warranted

Particularly disturbing are the sulphur dioxide figures obtained at the Staveley Road Station (which however was not operating in 1953) as this is situated in the Borough s first Smoke Control Area There were no periods of smog during the year 1963 When any premises are suspected of causing atmospheric pollution or when complaint is received that such pollution is being caused, investigations are carried out by the Public Health Inspectors to ascertain the cause and to try to find a remedy In this connection 220 visits, revisits or observations were made during the year The number of complaints of smoke or dust emissions was 60 during the year including one only about dust Action taken as a result of these complaints 17 verbal notices and one warning letter Observations were also made on 91 occasions on chimneys previously suspect and seven infringements were discovered two were dealt with by letter and five by verbal notice One of the smoke problems investigated arose as a direct result of the very cold weather at the beginning of the year which made it necessary for the aggre gate and mixing water used for concrete making on a road construction site to be steam heated so that work could continue Here some improvement was effected by the use of more suitable fuel 46 It has again been found that discussion on any smoke emission problems arising has been sufficient to bring about the required improvement either by the use of better fuels better firing methods or better maintenance Another aspect of the Department s work for the minimisation of atmospheric pollution has been in determining the height required for any new chimneys which may be erected in the Borough Two such cases were dealt with during the year One instance of a boiler being converted from solid fuel to oil burning was brought to the notice of the Department during the year Details of the work done in connection with the establishment of further Smoke Control Areas within the Borough during the year are set out in the next section Clean Air Act, 1956 The Borough's No 3 Smoke Control Order came into operation on the 1st June, 1963, covering 109 acres and comprising 1 564 dwellings of which number 360 were Council owned In addition there were 24 commercial and 5 miscellaneous premises but no industrial premises The amount of bituminous (smoky) coal in use was estimated to be 880 tons per annum and this required replacement by equivalent supplies of solid smokeless fuel, therms of gas and kilowatt hours of electricity, according to occupiers choice of heating apparatus, The total cost involved in converting firegrates in respect of which grant was claimed, amounted to £4 447 The grant paid amounted to £3 113 The Borough s No 4 Smoke Control Order was made by the Council on the 25th April, 1963 and confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 6th August 1963 The proposed date of operation was the 1st March 1964, but the Minister varied the date to the 1st July, 1964 The area covers 165 acres and comprises 1,537 private and 158 Council owned dwellings Of the total of 1 695 the following were exempted from the Order Under Part III or Part V of the Housing Act 1957 - 17 dwellings Tem porary prefabricated dwellings - 18 Highways improvements 54 dwellings Total exemptions 89 dwellings Within the area there are also 17 industrial, 99 commercial and 9 miscellaneous premises The area is that part of the Borough bounded by British Grove to the east to the north by Chiswick High Road (south side from British Grove to the east side of Devonshire Road) to the west by the east side of Devonshire Road (from Chiswick High Road to the River Thames boundary); to the south by the Borough (River) boundary The survey of the proposed Smoke Control Area No 5 was commenced during the year and it is anticipated the Council will make the appropriate Order early in 1964 The total number of visits and revisits made during the year in connection with Smoke Control Areas was 3,127 In addition , 2, 958 communications to occupiers were hand delivered The publication of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government circular 69/63 dated 17th December 1963 will of course require close study and will no doubt result in the Council adopting fresh scales of maximum costs for grant purposes Local publicity will need reviewing so that occupiers and owners can be made fully aware of the implications of the new procedure and the possible future trends in domestic heating 47 The supplies of fuel in the Borough during the severe winter of 1962/1963 were not seriously affected, but there were of course, many instances of dual hardship resulting from delay in delivery which could not in stances have been obviated. -48- GRAPH "C" VARIATION IN AVERAGE MONTHLY CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE IN BRENTFORD AND CHISWICK DURING 1963 CONCENTRATIONS EXPRESSED IN MICROGRAMMES PER CUBIC METRE -49- GRAPH "D" COMPARISON OF CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AT BRENTFORD CHISWICK (2 STATIONS) CENTRAL LONDON LEEDS AND LERWICK DURING 1963 CONCENTRATIONS EXPRESSED IN MICROGRAMMES PER CUBIC METRF -50- GRAPH "E" COMPARISON OF CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AT BRENTFORD AND AT CHISWICK HEATHFIELD TERRACE, DURING THE YEARS 1953 AND 1963 CONCENTRATIONS EXPRESSED IN MICROGRAMMES PER CUBIC METRE -51- GRAPH "F" COMPARISON OF CONCENTRATIONS OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE IN THE AIR AT BRENTFORD AND AT CHISWICK, HEATHFIELD TERRACE, DURING THE YEARS 1953 AND 1963 ALSO SHOWN ARE CONCENTRATIONS OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE IN THE AIR AT CHISWICK, STAVELEY ROAD, DURING THE YEAR 1963.

From time to time reports are issued by the Metropolitan Water Board on samples of water examined chemically bacteriologically, biologically and for tasting purposes, The samples are taken at various stages ranging from river water to water before and after filtration and to water before and after chlorination This constant checking ensures that the quality of the water entering the mains is satisfactory at all times The quantity of the water supply too, has been satisfactory throughout the year. Watch is also kept by the Board on the discharge of any radioactive effluents into waters which contribute eventually to the supplies they are treating, to ensure that the standards laid down are complied with. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The sewerage system for Brentford and Chiswick is mainly a 'separate' system in which surface water drainage and foul drainage are kept separate with two sets of drains along streets to which the various connections can be made In a few of the older areas of the Borough no surface water drainage exists and in these areas the foul and surface water drainage from properties is all taken into the foul sewer while surface water drainage from highways is taken into soakaways. The surface water drainage system is split into areas throughout the Borough and each area has an outfall into the River Thames There are approximately 18 outfalls of this kind along the length of the River within the Borough. The foul drainage system is based on the two areas of Brentford and Chiswick each area draining to one point within its boundary. The Brentford area drains to Town Meadow Depot and the Chiswick area to Corney Road Depot Before the advent of the West Middlesex Drainage Board the sewage received at Town Meadow Depot was pumped to a sewage disposal plant situated at Clayponds Gardens, and the sewage received at Corney Road Depot was treated at a plant within the Depot, both plants having outfalls into the Thames for effluent. Since the West Middlesex Drainage Board came into operation, the two sewage plants in the Borough -55- have ceased to operate and the two Depots were connected to a trunk sewer owned by the Board and running through the Borough The sewage from the Borough is carried by the trunk sewer to Mogden Works and treated and disposed of there It must be noted that the drainage system joins the trunk sewer in only two places The sewerage system of the Borough is, in general, considered to be sufficient to cope with the present and any likely future flows which may result from new development REFUSE COLLECTION Refuse is collected once per week from each house in the Borough and is disposed of, by collecting freighters, to a Controlled Tip outside the Borough SCHOOL SANITATION The following information on work carried out during 1963 in connection with the sanitation, lighting, and canteens in schools has been kindly provided by the Borough Education Officer:- Sanitation Beverley Road Infants' School Improvements in toilet accommodation for boys in infant and nursery classes, and installation of hot water Strand-on-the-Green Junior Improvements to external sanitary accommoda- Mixed School tion, Hogarth Practical Block Improvements to sanitary accommodation (former Secondary School now used as a youth Centre and by Polytechnic students) Ealing Road Junior Mixed School Sinks provided in 3 classrooms, Lionel Road Junior Mixed and Built-in cupboard and sink provided in one Infants' School classroom Ventilation Strand-on-the-Green Infants' French windows provided in 2 classrooms School Lighting Beverley Road Infants' School Lighting is some classrooms improved School Canteens Beverley Road Infants' School New sink unit provided Kitchen redecorated Tiling provided behind sinks Brentford Secondary Schools Incinerator provided in staff cloakroom Chiswick County Grammar Schools Tiling provided behind sinks 3 new sink units provided Ealing Road Primary Schools Canteen floor covered with polyvinyl tiles -56- Hogarth Primary Schools Incinerator provided in staff cloakroom Staveley Secondary Schools Incinerator provided in staff cloakroom Strand-on-the-Green Primary Tiling provided behind sinks 2 new sink Schools units provided, Gunnersbury Catholic Grammar New working top to table provided, School During the first ten weeks of 1963 the weather was exceptionally cold, and hard and continuous frost soon demonstrated the deficiencies of the plumbing systems in homes and buildings everywhere. Particular difficulty occurred in the older schools of the Borough, where outside sanitation became unusable and emergency arrangements had to be made whereby staff sanitation or other systems could be used to prevent the schools having to be closed Middlesex County Council was requested to speed the programme of modernising sanitary arrangements and to arrange for special heating of outside sanitary blocks so long as they continued to exist. -57- HOUSING RENT ACT, 1957 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (1) Number of applications for certificates - (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates - (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates (a) in respect of some but not all defects - (b) in respect of all defects - (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - (5) Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - (6) Number of Certificates issued - Applications for Cancellation of Certificates (7) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 1 (8) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 1 (9) Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objection - (10) Certificates cancelled by Local Authority - HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 Number of Grants for Improvements and Conversions 71 HOUSING ACT, 1957 By the end of the year under review, work on the Council's programme for the clearance of unfit houses in the Borough had progressed to such an extent that relatively few houses still remained to be dealt with. In 1955, the Council submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government proposals for dealing with houses within the Borough which appeared to be unfit for human habitation. The number of houses involved was 663 This list was revised in 1958 and again in 1961, at which time 334' houses still remained to be dealt with. When the position in relation to these 334 houses was reviewed in August of this year it was found that:- 64 houses had already been dealt with by way of Compulsory Purchase Orders,, Clearance Orders, Undertakings, etc. 62 houses had been found, on inspection, not to be unfit, and 70 houses were awaiting the result of action already taken in respect of them (This number includes 8 houses in Spring Grove, Chiswick, which though unfit, were excluded by the Minister of Housing and Local Government from a Compulsory Purchase Order ) -58- This left 146 houses still to be dealt with but of this number 140 are included in the High Street Redevelopment Area and the Walnut Tree Road Redevelopment Area and inspection of these will probably be delayed until redevelopment is imminent Although much has been done this does not mean that a halt can be called to the clearance of unfit properties The position will always be under review and houses will continue to be dealt with when their condition warrants it,, Details are set out below of the year s work towards the completion of the task of rehousing the occupants and effecting the demolition of unfit houses in clearance areas and elsewhere, including the remainder of those reported in previous years:- Albany Road No, 6 Compulsory Purchase Order, 1957 Nos. 19 - 25 (odd numbers) Albany Road Brentford) Nos. 29 - 37 (odd numbers) Albany Road, Brentford) (Demolished 1960) Nos. 280 - 289 (consecutive numbers) High Street, Brentford One family still remained to be rehoused from the High Street properties at the end of the year Percy Cottages Compulsory Purchase Order, 1960 Nos. 1-4 (consecutivenumbers)Percy Cottages, Brentford (Demolished 1962) Nos. 173 and 174 High Street, Brentford, and Nos. 175, 176 and 177 High Street, Brentford Two more of the properties (173 and 174 High Street) were demolished during the year One family (2 persons) was rehoused leaving one family still to be rehoused from the High Street properties at the end of the year Half Acre No. 1 Clearance Order, 1959 Nos 38 - 48 (consecutive numbers) Half Acre, Brentford.

It should be noted that the Borough Council's figures include a number of dwellings on the Syon Estate, Isleworth, which is in the adjoining Borough of Heston and Isleworth. Conversion of Council Houses No further conversions or improvements to Council owned houses were carried out in 1963. Overcrowding Nine cases of statutory overcrowding were brought to the notice of the Department and were considered by the Housing Committee during 1963„ It will be seen from the Housing Statistics on page 65 that fifty cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. Overcrowding is relieved in various ways, by private arrangements made by the families concerned, by Council re-housing, or by Council nomination under the Industrial Selection Scheme for housing in New Towns. The Borough Council decided to alter Housing policy to permit the allocation of specific points for medical reasons, and during 1963 many files of housing applicants were submitted for review by the Medical Officer of Health for this purpose As all Council housing should be allocated on need, this is a good thing and can save life as so many applicants are found to be living on top floors and using long flights of stairs while suffering from severe heart or lung disease, or disabling arthritic or paralytic conditions. Although overcrowding and damp housing are dangerous and unhealthy, human beings have considerable powers of resistance to such conditions, as was evidenced by the findings on shelter living during the War, but the crippling effect of the constant stair-climbing on these severely handicapped persons is very much more dangerous. -66- DISINFECTION Premises disinfected. Ordinary notifiable diseases 10 Other diseases 1 Premises treated for vermin 17 Premises treated for other pests (wasps, moths, ants and beetles) 17 Routine disinfection of blankets, bedding etc. were carried out on the premises in the above table as required In addition, articles of clothing and bedding, parcels of clothing destined for countries abroad, and when necessary, books for both public and private libraries, were disinfected on the Public Health Department premises. An arrangement is in force whereby the Southwest Middlesex Hospital Manage ment Committee undertakes to carry out emergency disinfection of smallpox infected clothing and bedding on demand. -67- MISCELLANEOUS RODENT CONTROL During the year 3 236 primary visits and re-visits were made by the Rodent Operatives to premises in the district in connection with rodent disinfestation The number of premises where treatment was carried out is as follows.- Private Houses 384 Factories 25 Shops 38 Schools 9 Parks and Open Spaces 7 None of these infestations were severe enough to be classed as major infestations. In addition to the above, two maintenance treatments to the sewers were carried out during the months of April/May, 1963 and October/November, 1963, and the following shows the number of manholes found to be infested. Date Manholes found to be infested April/May, 1963 3 October/November, 1963 21 The work of Rodent Control is carried out under the supervision of the Chief Public Health Inspector by three Rodent Operatives. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act for the regulation of the sale of pet animals requires all premises in which animals are sold for pets to be licensed by the local authority One licence was issued during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Three premises in the Borough are registered for the purpose of the above Act, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 2 thereof. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Five establishments were inspected under this heading and all were found to be satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Purpose No. of Licences Chiropody only 2 Massage and Electrical Treatment 2 Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 1 FREE WASHING FACILITIES IN PUBLIC CONVENIENCES Facilities for free hand washing are available in the Kew Bridge both Ladies' and 'Men's' at High Road 'Men's', Turnham Green Ladies", Linden Gardens Ladies, and Edensor Road Ladies Public Conveniences, paper towels and liquid soap in tilting dispensers being available in each, and in the conveniences at Albany Road, 'Men's' and 'Ladies', cold water and paper towels are -68- provided In some Park conveniences and in the Brentford Market, some provision is made for handwashing. During the year 1963, 51,400 paper towels, (34,000in Brentford, 17,400 in Chiswick), were issued and, in addition, those who preferred linen hand towels and tablet soap were able to hire these at a cost of 3d,, but this service ended in April, 1963 Before that date, in the same conveniences 850 of these towels were also used The number of paper towels used was almost 50% above the 1962 figure. In one other convenience in the Borough - Market Place Men's and Ladies", free washing facilities are not available as there is no longer an attendant, but it is still kept open weekdays and Sundays from 7 0 am to 8,0 pm, pending demolition This convenience is planned to be demolished in connection with the plan for the redevelopment of the High Street (east of the Courthouse). RIVER POLLUTION Reports have been received from the Middlesex County Council on samples of water taken by their Officers during the year from points on the River Brent between Wembley and Brentford High Street, These have been consistently bad during 1963, the river is foul still in spite of past conferences and plans of action for its purification. The water is not clear and there is evidence of oil entering the river Mechanical tugs and oil driven barges ply the river daily and their motors inevitably cause more turbulence in the water than did the quiet passage of the horse drawn boats of years gone by, and Brentford is at the receiving end of all the industrial pollution that occurs in the upper reaches of the River Brent and in the Grand Union Canal. Two areas of pollution of the River Thames from surface water sewers were found during the year, in each case due to unauthorised use by industrial firms of these sewers one other source was still untraced at the end of the year. STREET TRADING Certain prescribed areas in the district have been allocated for streettrading purposes There were 21 Street Trading sites and during 1963, 20 visits were paid to these sites to verify hygienic conditions. 31 hawkers of food were registered with the Council. CANAL BOATS Number of boats on register:- Motor propelled boats 89 Other boats 406 MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF COUNCIL STAFF The following medical examinations of Council staff were carried out during 1963:- No. of examinations for entry into the Superannuation Scheme 47 No. of examinations following expiration of sick leave 3 -69- NUCLEAR RADIATION Regular reports have been received from the Metropolitan Water Board indicating the amount of radio-active effluent ascertained in the sources of the water drunk locally During 1963 all discharges from the Atomic Energy Authorities were monitored and declared satisfactory A register is now being maintained of 'hose industrial concerns permitted to make use of radio-active material on their premises, with special reference to maximum permitted quantities, nature of radio-active element, and method of disposal. NOISE NUISANCE Twelve complaints of nuisance from noise were received during 1963, five were not substantiated details of the remaining seven were as follows:- (1) River embankment works - pile driving Main complaint - night times Ceased. (2) Noise from refrigerator motors at Public House No undue noise heard and motors regularly serviced However, licensee agreed to switch off motors when public house closes each evening. (3) Noise from factory No noise heard in house when heavy machines working Machines due for overhaul. (4) Noise from refrigerator motors at a Supermarket Manufacturer of motors asked to overhaul - noise level reduced. (5) Noise from air conditioning plant at factory Investigation carried out Arranged for plant to be closed down during night time. (6) Noise of doors banging from Railway Station - no action taken. (7) Noise from the repairing of vehicles in yard - no more work now done on vehicles in the yard. OFFENSIVE SMELLS Prom time to time complaints of offensive smells require investigation the source of the smell sought and treated whether it is an offensive accumula tionor faulty sanitation, but a more pervading and persistent odour coming into the Borough from a neighbouring district continued to cause difficulty from time to time during the year as it was coming from a Sewage Works the works done to improve conditions there had not had a great deal of effect upon the nuisance by the end of 1963 and further improvements were in progress. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS ESTABLISHMENTS New Byelaws for the control of these establishments were brought into fOrce during the year and copies were sent to all local hairdressers and barbers to inform them of the sanitary requirements. -70- HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee Brentford Hospital, Chiswick Maternity Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital clayponds Wing (formerly Clayponds Hospital) are situated within the Borough and are administered by the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee under the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946.
