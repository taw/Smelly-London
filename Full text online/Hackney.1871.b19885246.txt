HAC 51 REPORT ON THE SANITARY STATE OF THE HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOE THE YEAR 1871, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., ETC., Author of Essays on Scarlatina and its Etiology ; Scarlatinal Dropsy; the Relative Mortalities of Male and Female Children, &c., PRESIDENT OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY; MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TO THE DISTRICT. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD BY A. T. ROBERTS, STEAM WORKS. 5, HACKNEY ROAD, LONDON. 1872. SANITARY REPORT, 1871. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, The epidemic of Small Pox which has caused so very large a mortality this year in the Metropolis, viz: 7,876 out of a total of 80,332 deaths, or nearly one tenth of the whole, was remarkable not so much for the period of its occurrence as for its great extent and severity. As I pointed out in my last report, there is a very decided tendency for eruptive fevers to assume an epidemic form, in the Metropolis, about once in four years, and then gradually to cause only their ordinary death rate. As this period is nearly the same in the Metropolis as regards Whooping Cough, Small Pox, Measles, and Scarlet Fever, it rarely happens that we have more than one or two of these diseases epidemic at the same time, so that the comparative mortality from these diseases has oscillated since my appointment within moderate limits; the mean death-rate from all maladies included in class 1, being in this district about 21 per cent. of the whole. This year, however, 400 deaths from Small Pox, 76 from Whooping Cough, and 122 from Diarrhcea, have raised the per centage to no less than 28.2 per cent. which 4 is far in excess of that for 1866, when Cholera prevailed, indeed there were nearly three times as many deaths in this district from Small Pox last year, as from Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhœa in 1866. In order to trace out the laws of epidemic diseases we must not confine our enquiries to too small areas, nor to any one area, hut as my report is only for the consideration of this Board, I do not purpose extending my table to any population outside the Metropolis, and therefore submit for your consideration the mortality from Small Pox in the years 1840-72.

The fourth period includes three years only, when it was epidemic in the first year. In the other periods of four years it prevailed in the first years of each period in all instances, but was also epidemic in 1866, which 5 was the last year of the seventh period. There is hut little doubt that in the course of time we shall he able to ascertain the causes which retard or accelerate the epidemic periods, but at present we have not sufficient reliable data upon which to base our calculations. If we now group the several mortalities under the headings of the first, second, third, and fourth years of each period of four years, we shall bring out the facts that the number of deaths iu all the first years was more than two fifths of the whole; that the number in second and fourth years of each period was nearly the same, viz.: 5239 and 5389 respectively; that of the third was much below either of the others, viz.: 3078 only. The number 5397 should be increased by one-seventh, as it contains one year less than the other columns and ought therefore to be 6168 or thereabouts. The necessary correction is made in the per centageS. Table II. Deaths from Small Pox, 1840-70.

The most cursory examination of this table shows, I think conclusively, that the disease has been epidemic in certain years in obedience to certain causes which permanently influence its course. As I stated in my last report, this tendency to periodical recurrence is no reason for relaxing our efforts to diminish its spreading and intensity by proper sanitary precautions, but on the contrary should spur us on to greater efforts in the hope of ascertaining the causes which enable it to assume this form. There is also another reason why we should remember this tendency to become epidemic every fourth year, viz: that vaccination should be most strenuously enforced in the year before an epidemic is expected, so as to diminish the number of those who would otherwise be susceptible to an attack. It must not be supposed that I believe effective vaccination to be a positive protection against an attack, because I do not, but I consider it to afford at least as good a protection as an attack of Small Pox would do. I had under my care, nearly twenty years ago, a lad thirteen years of age who was deeply pitted from a former attack of the disease, and who yet died from the second, which assumed a confluent form. I have seen numerous cases of second attacks of Small Pox, and one of a third, and in nearly all, the progress of the malady was similar to that which it takes after efficient vaccination. The chief points to be attended to are, that the vaccine lymph is to be taken not later than the morning of the eighth day after vaccination; that there shall not be any intermixture of blood with the lymph; that in primary vaccination not less than four punctures or scratches be made; and that re-vaccination be performed as soon as the person has done growing. When less than four 7 scars result from the vaccination it is advisible for the re-vaccination to be done during the seventh year of life, and again about sixteen years of age. The good effects of vaccination, even although it is iu very many eases imperfectly performed, is well shewn by the statistics of the Small Pox Hospitals, Homierton. During the year 1871 there were 3149 admissions, of which 59.2 per cent. were vaccinated, so that if the mortality of the vaccinated and nonvaccinated had been relatively alike there would have been 59.2 per cent. of all the deaths amongst the vaccinated and only 40.8 amongst the non-vaccinated. The returns made to the Registrar of Hackney Sub-District (from which I have extracted them) shew that 61.6 per cent. of all the deaths happened amongst the 40.8 per cent. non-vaccinated, and 38.4 per cent, amongst the 59.2 per cent. which were vaccinated. These returns are, however, not nearly so favourable to vaccinatiou as the statistics compiled by Mr. Marson at the Holloway Hospital. This perhaps may be caused by my having entered amongst the vaccinated all those in which the words "non-vaccinated" was not entered against the death. Mr. Marson states in his report, that whilst the average mortality of all admitted is about 15 per cent., that amongst the unvaccinated it is about 37 per cent., that when vaccination has been properly performed the rate of death is only about 2.5 per cent., and when badly done, about 8.8 per cent,, and that it varies according to the number of good marks on the arm. When there were four marks the mortality was only 0.6 per cent.; where there were three, it was 1.9 per cent.; where two, it was 4.7 per cent; and where only one, 7.7 per cent. In cases where it was said that vaccination had been done in childhood, but there was not any mark, the mortality was ns high as 23.6 per cent. Dr. Monk 8 also remarks in his report for 1871, that nothing has occurred to shake his confidence in vaccination when properly performed, hut that almost all cases of failure of vaccination have occurred in consequence of the careless and imperfect manner in which it has been practised. Dr. Monk further considers that the adult population of the country should he re-vaccinated, except when the person has had Small Pox, or unless he have four good marks as evidence of the goodness of the primary vaccination. It is useless to vaccinate persons who have undoubted symptoms of the disease, as experience shows that re-vaccination either does not then succeed, or does not modify its course. There is one other point which is very important in connection with vaccination, viz: not only that the mortality is very much less, but that the patient suffers very much less, as the fever and general discomfort in a non-protected case usually increase until the ninth or tenth day, whilst in protected cases they generally diminish soon after the eruption comes out. The rate of death amongst those attacked was unusually high in this epidemic, having been 18.5 per cent. for all London; 18.6 per cent. at the Small Pox Hospital in this district; 18.2 per cent. at Stockwell, and 19 per cent. at Upper Holloway. This per-centage at the Homerton Small Pox Hospitals is a little greater than that obtained by calculating the number of admissions and deaths furnished to me by Drs. Gayton and Collie. According to their returns, the admissions in the Small Pox Hospital were 1955 and the deaths 387; in the Fever Hospital the admissions were 1194 and the deaths 180, making a total of 3149 admissions and 367 deaths, being a mortality of 18 per cent. We make 19 deaths more, viz., 586, but have included some deaths returned as being from other causes, which they have excluded, although the persons were admitted for 9 Small Pox. The difference 0.6 per cent. is too small to take much notice of either way. The total number of deaths from Small Pox in London was 7876, or about 2.4 per 1000, whilst in Hackney 400 deaths of residents occurred in a population calculated in July 1st, 1871, to have been 126,126, or at the rate of 3.1 per 1000. This is a very large proportion of deaths, but looking at the unusually large number of non-vaccinated cases admitted to the Hospital, is not larger than might have been expected, especially when we consider the mortality from this disease in Shoreditch and Bethnal Green. In Shoreditch with a population of 127,160 or only 1034 above that of this district, there were 439 deaths registered, which with 85 deaths in the Homerton Hospitals of residents of that parish, make a total of 524 deaths. In Bethnal Green with a population of 120,200, there were 375 deaths registered in the parish and no less than 129 in the Small Pox Hospitals, making a total of 504 deaths, or more than 25 per cent. above our mortality, although our population was larger than theirs. This may to a certain extent be accounted for by the very large proportion of deaths which occurred in the hospitals as compared with those at private residences, for no less than 159 deaths out of the whole 400 happened in the Homerton, Guardians', and Gladstone's Hospitals, viz., 121 in the first, 30 in the second, and 8 in the last. There is no doubt that if as large a proportion of cases had been removed from their homes at the outbreak of the epidemic as after the opening of the Small Pox Hospitals, there would not have been so many cases or deaths. A table shewing the deaths in the public Institutions and the district generally, for each month in the year will be found in the appendix, also the number of deaths for each of the surrounding parishes or districts. 10 It is much to be regretted that we could not obtain any knowledge of the occurrence of Small Pox cases except through the Relieving Officers, the books of the Poor Law Medical Officers, and the returns of deaths. I have just stated that 241 deaths occurred at the houses of the patients, now allowing the death-rate of all the attacks to have been one in every six, we should have 1446 cases in private houses, whilst we only obtained information respecting its occurrence in 829 houses, which were but few more than the number treated in public practice, so that above 1200 cases were unknown to us and treated by private practitioners. The number of cases coming under our notice in each month was as follows: 1870—October, 5; November, 10; December, 27; 1871—January, 92; February, 104; March, 118; April, 126; May, 127; June, 97; July, 49; August, 17; September, 24; October, 22; November, 22, and December, 13; making a total from the begining of the epidemic of 856 cases. There is one rather important matter for consideration, viz., whether or not the Small Pox Hospital at Homerton has acted in any as a focus of disease to the district. 1 believe that a careful examination of the following facts will show that it has. At the end of the report there will be found a list of streets and places examined for Sanitary purposes, with the number of houses, families and inhabitants in each, also the number of cases of epidemic diseases which came to our knowledge. Deselecting first the streets immediately around the Hospital and ascertaining the number of Small Pox cases which occurred amongst the inhabitants, we find that there were no less than 110 cases amongst 1492 inhabitants residing in 243 houses, whilst there were only 703 cases in 36,177 inhabitants residing in 6,124 houses, which were all the houses inspected. In the 11 streets around the Hospital there happened 73 cases in 1000 inhabitants, whilst in the other streets enumerated in the list, which are of a similar character, or nearly so, to those at Homerton, there were 19 cases in each 1000 inhabitants. To carry the comparison further I collected in one group all the other streets in which the disease had prevailed most severely, some of which are the worst in this district as regards the poverty of the residents and the bad structural condition of the houses, and compared the results with those just stated. I then found that in those there were 90 cases amongst 1980 people residing in 339 houses, or at the rate of 45 cases in 1000 inhabitants against 73 in the same number at Homerton.* This result is what I expected at the time it wa3 proposed to build the Hospital on its present site, as I believe the number congregated in the wards to be too great to be contained in any one building or any aggregation of contiguous buildings. The cubical space for each patient is sufficient, especially as the wards are well ventilated, but it must not be forgotten that the free ventilation which renders the wards healthful for the patients, may also assist in carrying the disease to those outside the building. I believe in ordinary (i.e.) non-epidemic years, the number in the Hospital will not be injurious to the district, but I am most . decidedly of opinion that so large a number as were usually to be found in the wards last year ought never again to be placed there, but that arrangements should be made for preventing so great an influx of patients. A similar remark may be made as regards the Fever Hospital, which in my opinion should never be filled in any epidemic of Fever as the Hospitals were with Small Pox cases in 1871. As a very large number of cases have been brought to the Hospital from other districts,, and a corresponding proportion of * See appendix, Table I. 12 deaths has occurred there and been registered in this district, it became necessary, in order to ascertain the true mortality for the district, to eliminate all the deaths of non-residents. I was therefore compelled to examine each return of the Registrar for Hackney to find out how many should be placed to our account, when I ascertained that 113 deaths were recorded of inhabitants of Hackney, and 578 of non-residents. I then applied to Drs. Gayton and Collie, the Medical Superintendents, for the number of admissions, which were very kindly furnished to me, shewing that under Dr. Gayton's care there were 412 admitted from Hackney in 1871 out of a total of 1955; and that 1194 cases, including residents of Hackney, were admitted under Dr. Collie. Dr. Gayton's return, which I append, indicates the largest number for Hackney to have occurred in June, viz., 57, and for all parishes in February and July, when 216 and 204 were respectively, admitted. The return for February must not however be taken as indicating that the greatest prevalence of the disease happened in that month, because after the Hospital was filled, which it was in February, the number of admissions would be regulated by the number of vacancies. Having given a brief account of the Small Pox epidemic I now purpose, very succinctly, stating what steps were taken to prevent its spreading. Soon after the disease appeared it was proposed to take some building, or make arrangements with some hospital, for the reception of cases under the powers conferred on the Board by the Sanitary Act, when the Managers of Mrs. Gladstone's Convalescent Home proposed to open it for Convalescent cases, and to admit a certain number of the sick from this district. The offer was at first agreed to, but subsequently opposed, so that only 19 residents were admitted there. In the meantime the Guardians of the Poor took some houses in Brooksby's Walk and in High Street, Homerton, for treating 13 the disease, which houses are termed in this report the Guardians' Hospital. An ambulance was provided by this Board and a Eraser's Disinfecting Oven and Shed were erected for the disinfecting of bedding, clothing, &c. This oven was not erected until nearly the middle of the year in consequence of the great difficulty in procuring a site, but eventually it was placed on an arch built over part of the Marsh Sewer and on ground recovered from the sewer at Gainsborough Road, Hackney Wick. Since its opening on July 12th, no less than 1270 articles of bedding or clothing have been disinfected, consisting of 107 beds, 116 mattrasses, 92 bolsters, 176 pillows, 40 blankets, 26 sheets, 23 counterpanes, 32 carpets, and 658 other articles. The men were employed 598 hours or nearly 60 days each. The men were paid by the hour, so that the cost for labour was £23 16s. 8d., and for fuel £3 14s. l1d., making a total cost for working of £27 l1s. 7d. Against this there was received a sum of £9 14s. from persons who could afford to pay, so that the nett cost of working is comparatively small, and I should expect that the outlay for future repairs will be but trifling. In addition to removing and disinfecting articles of clothing, no less than 928 houses were disinfected by the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and disinfectants liberally supplied to the inhabitants The water closets in most of the infected places were flushed with Carbolic Acid water, the streets and courts well watered with it, and all the gullies and sewers in the district also disinfected. There were used 115 gallons of common acid for roads, sewers, and water closets; 90 gallons of white acid distributed in 900 bottles, and 1270 pounds of disinfecting (carbolic acid) powder were given away in 1-lb. bags. In addition to these means for checking the spreading the disease, no less than 158 bodies were removed to the mortuary by order of the Sanitary Officers, the cause of death in nearly all these cases was Small 14 Pox, and consequently there were about 120 dead bodies more than usual taken to the mortuary. This unusually large number of bodies removed, rendered some additional fittings necessary at the mortuary, which were provided by your order. In the early part of January a circular letter was sent to all Clergymen, Ministers of Religion, Missionaries, Masters of Schools, Relieving Officers, and also as far as was known to District Visitors residing in the district, requesting them to inform me of any cases of infectious disease which might come under their notice. Another circular letter was sent to all Medical Practitioners in the district, requesting information of all cases coming under their notice in which disinfection was not properly carried out, either through poverty or carelessness, or where infectious diseases were likely to be intensified by nuisances or any other local causes. A postal card having my name, with " Town Hall, Hackney" printed thereon, was enclosed with this letter circular, and similar postal cards were supplied, as required, to the Relieving Officers from whom we have received important information. As a further precaution, house to house inspections were made in the infected districts, and nearly 1000 notices for the prevention of overcrowding were served during November and December, 1870, and January and February, 1871, and notices were served to abate overcrowding whenever houses or separate rooms were found to contain too many inhabitants. During the epidemic I was frequently called upon late at night and on Sundays to issue an order for the use of the ambulance for removal of those affected, and the same happened more frequently still tothe Chief Inspector. In one of the rooms where I visited, in oonsequence of a request to order the removal of some of the inmates, I found four cases in two rooms, two recovering and 15 two very bad, but still capable of removal. Both rooms and the beds contained in them, were used by the sick, so that the rest of the family occupied the same rooms and probably the same beds with the them, as there was not any other bed clothing than those on the sick. The patients, grown up women, refused to go to the Workhouse Hospital, but after much persuasion they were removed by the Sanitary Officers to Mrs. Gladstone's Hospital, and fresh bedding supplied to the family from the Workhouse. Several Summonses were taken out under the Sanitary Act against persons who removed clothing and other articles without previous disinfection, and against others having charge of the sick who had allowed individuals affected with Small Pox to be exposed in a public place; also against an Undertaker for removing in an open cart the dead body of a person who had died from Small Pox. In two cases the Magistrate fined washerwomen for taking in washing and sending it home without disinfection, when they had Small Pox in the house; another person was fined for sending his servant through the public streets to her home when she was suffering from the disease. The Summons against the undertaker was dismissed, although I proved that the coffin was covered with cloth and removed to his shop instead of to our mortuary, on the ground that a coffin containing a dead body did not come within the meaning of the Act. The father of a patient was also fined twenty-five shillings for removing the clothes and bedding, which his son had used whilst ill, without previously disinfecting them. In consequence of rag and other refuse being thrown into the dust holes at the Small Pox and Fever Hospitals, Homerton, I paid several visits there and wrote some letters, which eventually induced the Managers to order all poultices and rags to be 16 burned and the dust disinfected before removal. This was most essential, as the dust-men were seen to take the rags out of the dust and place them in a bag for sale. The men were warned not to do so for the future if they found any in the dust, even although disinfectants were freely used. Before passing from the subject of the Small Pox Epidemic, I desire to express my great objection to the term "preventable diseases" as used by the Registrar General. A cursory perusal of his reports would lead many to believe that the best test of the Sanitary condition of any given locality is that afforded by the proportion of deaths from "all causes" to those from epidemic diseases, for all diseases of that class are grouped together as preventable diseases. Now as I have many times stated to this Board and elsewhere, that there is very good grounds for believing that epidemic diseases will never cease to prevail in civilised life, as the ordinary courtesies of society necessitate a certain intermixture of the population, and consequently of persons being exposed to the causes of such diseases. Besides which, as I have before stated, the proportion of deaths from these causes does not ordinarily vary very greatly from year to year, as one or more is almost invariably epidemic at any given period. Further, as the eruptive fevers occur generally but once in a person's lifetime, the prevalence of disease and the consequent mortality will depend in a great measure on the number susceptiblo to it. In a community containing an excessive proportion of children, as compared with the adult population, we must expect a correspondingly large proportion of Scarlet Fever, Measles, Whooping Cough and Diarrhœa, so that the death-rate from these causes must be likely to be higher in this district both now and for the future than hitherto, as there are a larger proportion of children and a comparatively smaller number of adults than there were before 1806. It has been 17 suggested that in the same way as there is probably only one force in nature which manifests itself as light, heat, electricity, magnetism, motion, chemical and perhaps vital action, according to the "material substratum" through which it is rendered cognizable to our senses, so there may be only one zymotic force which can give rise to Measles, Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, or fever according to the part of the body attacked. There is, however, no such proof of the latter proposition as of the former, which as pointed out in my "report on the past and present condition of the Hackney District" (1856), was then pretty fully proved. The total number of deaths during the year has been very large, viz., 2814 against 2464 last year, but considering the immense mortality from Small Pox it is less than for 1870, and considerably less than in 1869. These 2814 deaths include 66 deaths in the East London Union and 83 in the German Hospital, but exclude 471 deaths of non-residents which occurred in the Small Pox Hospitals. There were 41.48 births against the 2814 deaths, or deducting the 66 deaths in the City of London Union, against 2748 deaths, leaving a surplus of 1492 births over deaths. This is a large excess and shows that, even without immigration, the population of the district is considerably on the increase. There were, as shewn in Table III, 316 births in Stoke Newiugton, 204 in Stamford Hill, 971 in West Hackney, 1583 in Hackney, and 1074 in South Hackney, the per centages being 7.6 in the first named sub-district, 4.9 in the second, 23.4 in the third, 38.2 in the fourth, and 25.9 in the last. These do not vary very much from those of last year except that there is a decided increase in Stoke Newington. 18 Table III. 1871.—Births in each Sub-District. 52 Weeks. Quarters. Stoke Newingtn.

The largest number of the 2814 deaths occurred in the first quarter, viz., 798, and the next largest in the last, viz., 705, the mortality in the two other quarters being nearer one another, viz., 665 in the second and 646 in the third. It is also very singular that by far the largest number of births were registered in the first quarter and the next largest in the fourth. There were 165 deaths in Stoke Newington, 100 in Stamford Hill, 631 in West Hackney, 1312 in Hackney, and 605 in South Hackney. The number in Hackney is far larger than in any other sub-district as it includes the deaths in the City of London Union, the German Hospital, the Hackney Workhouse, and the Small Pox and Fever Hospitals. It is useless therefore to calculate any per centages for the sub-districts, as it would entail much labour and lead to little useful results. 19 Table IV. 1871.—Deaths in each Sub-District. 52 Weeks.

The first thing which strikes us, is the excessive mortality from epidemic diseases, viz., 800 or 28.4 per cent. of the whole against 20.8 per cent. in former years. This great death rate was caused, as is shewn in Table VI., by the excessive mortality from Small Pox and the large number of deaths from Diarrhœa. The death rate from Class 1 will scarcely be as low for the future as before, as all the deaths from Fevers and Small Pox will now be included in our returns, whilst many have been unavoidably left out before, although they have been as far as possible allowed for in calculating the per centage of deaths for each year. As a matter of course, as the rate is so high for Class l,the proportion would be smaller for all the other classes, although on comparing the numbers with those for last year they will be found to be in excess. Thus the deaths from Tubercular Affections in 1870 were 412 against 438 in 1871; from Diseases of the Inspiratory Organs, 392 in 1870, to 441 in 1871, and from Affections of the Digestive and Urinary Organs, 143 in 1870 to 161 in 1871, and no less than 161 deaths from Premature Birth and Atrophy against 140 in 1871. On the other hand, there were 164 deaths registered as from Old Age in 1870 to only 144 in 1871. 20 Table V. Deaths in Hackney, 1871. causes of death. Totals. Per Centages.

The total number was very large, viz. 751, the largest in any previous year having been 592, which corrected for increase of population would be 639, so that the excess in 1871 was no less than 11.2.

It is therefore likely to be epidemic in 1872-78. The fatality of Scarlet Fever was much less than in 1869 and 1870, but was still high, so that it is likely to be comparatively small during this and the following year. Whooping Cough has 76 deaths placed to its account, which is rather above the average, and as the excessive mortality was chiefly registered in the autumn, it is probable that it will remain high to the end of the year. The mortality from Fever was very small indeed, especially when we consider that all our deaths from this cause were included in our returns. There is one other matter to which I must draw your especial attention, viz., the large number of deaths from Diarrhœa, Choleraic Diarrhoea and Cholera. The deaths from Diarrhœa were nearly as numerous as in 1865 (the year before the Cholera outbreak), whilst those from Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea were greater than in that year. These are very important when taken together with the steady march of Cholera from the East Indies to Persia, thence to Austria, Prussia, and other continental countries, and especially to Hamburg. It is also well known that one case of the disease occurred at Hull in a sailor who came from Hamburg. The greatest watchfulness must therefore be exercised, both now and during the ensuing summer and autumn. I do not expect, even if an outbreak should occur, that it will be very severe, as the district is in a better Sanitary condition than it was in 1866, and therefore we are better prepared to prevent its spreading. The mortality from Diarrhcea was however not excessive, when the great heat of August and September is taken into consideration, because the deaths 22 from this disease is always in proportion to the highest temperature attained, provided it lasts for two or three weeks.

In 1870 there were only 18.4 per cent. of the whole registered between these ages, whilst in 1871 there were 21.2 per cent. The mortality under 5 years was nearly the same in both, viz., 39.1 in 1871, and 39.0 per cent. in 1870. On the other hand there were fewer between 65 and 75 in the proportion of 8.8 per cent. to 10.6 per cent. There were 637 deaths under 1, 466 between 1 and 5, 180 between 5 and 15, 204 between 15 and 25, 212 between 25 and 35, 195 between 35 and 45, 208 between 45 and 55, 215 between 55 and 65, 246 between 65 and 75, no less than 251 who died above 75 years of age, including 1 of above 95. The rate of death under 1 year is satisfactory, as it is usually a good guide as to the Sanitary condition of a district. In London generally the rate was 24.7 per cent. of the whole, and in Hackney only 22.6 per cent. This rate is smaller than in any large town except Portsmouth where it was only 19.3 per cent., whilst it was above 30 per cent. in Liverpool, Manchester, Salford, Sunderland, and Newcastle. The proportion of deaths 23 under one year old, to all the births, is more satisfactory still, as it was only 15.3 per cent. against 17.1 per cent. for all London, and 19.2 per cent. for seventeen large towns. In Liverpool no less than 26.9 per cent.; Leicester, 24.1 per cent.; Newcastle, 22.3 per cent., and Sunderland, 22.2 per cent. of all the children horn, died during the first year of life. Of course neglect of Sanitary measures is hy no means the chief cause of a great infant mortality, as want of proper nourishment, warmth, and care are more injurious to infant life than even the absence of Sauitary appliances. The proportion of mothers who go out to work, leaving the infants to the care of young children or neighbours, with nothing but milk and water or thin gruel, which is sucked from a stinking bottle, is not so great here or in London generally as in the manufacturing districts, although it prevails in London to a considerable extent. The infant mortality here ought not therefore to be so great as in these localities, but 1 do not think that there should be so great a difference even after allowing for all the causes of death which I have mentioned. The mortality for Hackney was at the rate 219 per 10,000 inhabitants, which although the highest since 1866 was only 1 per 10.000 inhabitants in excess of that for 1869, and singularly to say, the annual rate for all London was 247 per 10,000 in 1871, against 246 in 1869 and 265 in 1866, so that the public health of the district still continues far above that of London generally. In making this calculation I have included the deaths in the German Hospital, but excluded those in the City of London Union. The annual rate of mortality for the Northern districts was as high as 256, and of the Eastern districts 262 per 10,000, so that Hackney is exceptionally low in its mortality when that of the surrounding districts is considered. 24 A.s the periodical examination of all the houses in a district which are occupied by the poorer classes must from the foundation on which all real Sanitary work is based, I shall now proceed very briefly to discuss the results of our inspections, premising that second or third inspections the same year, as well as visits to see if the nuisances aro abated, are not mentioned in our tables. In 1867 when the present system of inspection was first carried out, there were 5512 houses inspected, and in 1871, 6124; the excess in number examined this year, consisting of houses which have been built and occupied since 1867. The 6124 houses contained 26,167 inhabited rooms, excluding washhouses and kitchens not used as dwelling rooms, 3974 families, and 36,177 inmates. Amongst these 36,177 inhabitants, 691 cases of Small Pox, 40 of Scarlet Fever, 11 of Typhus or Typhoid aud 5 of simple Fever came to our notice. There were also no less than 2419 houses, or about 39 per cent. of the whole, which contained some nuisance which rendered them, more or less, unfit to live in. I do not mean that they were uninhabitable, but that they were more less injurious to the inhabitants. In addition to the 6124 houses inspected at their proper time, there were 928 houses inspected in consequence of epidemic diseases having occurred therein. Many of these were good class houses in which deaths from Small Pox or other eruptive fevers had occured. There were also 475 premises inspected in consequence of complaints received; 177 cow-sheds and slaughter-houses visited, many on several occasions; 150 greengrocers' and 60 fishmongers' yards inspected; 123 bake-houses visited, and other places, making an aggregate of 8129 premises inspected during the year. There is one very important point connected with the tabular statement of Nuisances at the end of the appendix, viz., that only 475 nuisances were brought to our notice by complaints out 25 of the total 8129. This is about the usual number, as 486 complaints were received here in 1870. The small proportion of nuisances complained of, as compared with those discovered on inspection, shews the great value of the Sanitary Act, by which inspection with a view to ascertain the existence of nuisances was made a duty of Local Boards, the practice previously being not to inspect or visit any premises unless they were complained of. In the same table we find recorded the removal of 113 privy cesspools and the connection of the drains and closets with the new Sewer laid down by this Board. There are a very few cesspools still remaining, because sewers have not in all cases been brought within the distance mentioned in the Metropolis Local Management Act, and because some cesspools have been covered over instead of having been filled up. As the latter come to our knowledge they are at once filled up, indeed year by year the number of nuisances arising from defective drainage becomes less, whilst on the other those from other causes are decidedly on the increase, in consequence of the great number of new houses which are built every year. The number of pigsties removed have also been much in excess of those in 1870, no less than 36 premises on which pigs were kept so as to be a nuisance, came to our knowledge in 1871, against 13 in 1870. The number of notices served was large, 752 having been served for the prevention of overcrowding; 928 for the disinfection of premises; 3520 preliminary notices for the removal of nuisances of all kinds; 1424 peremptory or second notices, and 501 statutory, which are only served after the efforts of the junior Inspectors have failed to obtain the abatement of the nuisances. The number of persons summoned to the Police Courts, viz. 63, was less than in former years, and even this will probably diminish year by year when owners of property find 26 that all works necessary to make a house safe and habitable will be enforced in this district. The removal of house refuse and dust has entailed for some years past a very great responsibility on the Sanitary staff, and especially during this year, as instead of having them removed by one or more contractors for a lump sum, the Board determined to do the work themselves, contracting for the carts, horses, implements, and one man to each cart. When this plan was first carried out in March, 1871, the contract price was 9/- per day, which included, for some parts of the district, two men to each cart, and in others three men to two carts. The cost for removing 3140 loads during the quarter ending June 24th, was £485 18s. From June 24th to March 25th in 1872, there were removed 11,226 loads of dust at a cost of £1530 18s. 0d., when a different system was adopted. During the latter nine months the contract price was 2/3 per load, the contractor providing the necessary number of carts with one man to each cart and also a shovel, basket, ladder. The contractor's men are also responsible for the safe custody of the carts, horses, and implements. The Board engaged the necessary number of men to assist in the removal, sometimes one man to each cart, but generally one man to two carts, the number of carts employed varying between 10 and 22. The Board also during the whole of this period employed an Inspector of dust, who has had no other duties to perform than to superintend its removal. The district is divided into nine sub-divisions, so that a cart can go through or into every road, street, lane, court, alley and place once every week. About four thousand D cards were distributed during the year, informing the inhabitants of the day on which the carts will pass, and that the card is to be placed in the window if they wished the dust to be removed. The plan has been far more satisfactory than any other, although 3734 requests for 27 removal were made at the Town Hall during 1871. More than half of these, viz. 2007, were made during the first three months of the 3'ear, when the old system of contracting for a lump sum was in force, and in the month afterwards before the new system was properly organised. Now when we consider that at the present time all complaints are forwarded to us, instead of partly to the contractors and partly to us, I think we may he well satisfied at the result. The cost by day work was 3/1, and on the load system was only 2/8 ½ per load. Several important matters involving the expenditure of a great deal of time have been under the consideration of the Board and the Sanitary Committee. The first which 1 will mention is the proceedings in Chancery against Mr. Davey for a nuisance arising from the distillation of gas-tar, and the production of "light oil" or impure naptha, "dead oil" or impure carbolic acid, authrecene "green oil" and hard pitch; also from the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia from gasliquor, from the burning of "dead oil" instead of coal or coke. Proceedings had been taken on several occasions before the Magistrates of the Worship Street Police Court, in this and former years without permanently good results, so that in April of this year a summons was taken out, and was adjourned at the hearing on several occasions to enable the defendant to carry out the recommendation of Professor Redwood, to construct an apparatus for absorbing the noxious gases. As all these and other apparatus previously erected failed to abate the nuisance, and as the inhabitants complained very much of the abominable smell, the matter was referred to the Sanitary Committee to obtain the necessary legal and medical assistance for the suppression of the nuisance. By their directions I frequently inspected the premises, and accompanied Drs. Letheby, Odliug, and Stevenson at their inspections, and made one affidavit 28 myself and a joint affidavit with Mr. Ellis on the thirteenth of December. Numerous other affidavits were filed on the same day by Drs. Letheby and Stevenson, and by inhabitants who complained of the smell. These measures were effectual in obtaining the removal of the nuisance, as v. ill be stated more at length in my next report. Another important question was as to the propriety of allowing a new Cemetery to be formed at the Clapton Park Estate on the low ground contiguous to the Lea Cut. As I stated in my evidence before Mr. Holland, the Medical Inspector of Graveyards, it was unfit for the purpose, because a considerable proportion of it was not much above the level of the lowest sewer into which it could be drained, and as water was usually to be met with about five feet below the surface of the ground at its lowest part, so that if more than one coffin were placed in a grave it would soon be covered with water, even if earth were placed on the lowest part. After two inspections and hearing numerous witnesses for and against the scheme, Mr. Holland made so unfavourable a report that the Secretary of State refused to sanction it. I also accompanied Mr. Holland in making an Inspection of the old burial ground in Well Street, in consequence of complaints as to interments within a short distance of the houses in St. Thomas Place. After referiug to the Order in Council and making several measurements, the Vicar and Churchwardens agreed not to bury any one there except in the family vaults, so that this ground is closed. I also attended at the Worship Street Police Court to give evidence in favour of the prosecution against the Rev. Mr. Hugo, for burying a child contrary to the provisions of the Order in Council, when Mr. Newton ordered Mr. Hugo to pay a penalty of five pounds and costs. I also inspected Homerton Churchyard and obtained a restriction as to common intements, so that no one 29 will be buried there for the future, except in family graves. In addition to these I have had some correspondence with the Rector of Hackney respecting the interments in the Old Churchyard, as I am not satisfied as to the relationship of some of those who have been buried there in the so called family graves. During the hot weather numerous complaints were made respecting the bad state of the water in the Regents Canal, so that I made repeated inspections of the Canal and laid a report before you on the 29th of September asking for an order to take proceedings against the Company in conjunction with Dr. Sutton the Medical Officer of Health of Shoreditoh, and with Dr. Sarvis of Bethnal Green. As heavy rain set in about that time and the weather became cool, it was deemed advisable to postpone any action until the following year. A similar course was adopted as regards the Bathing Lake, Victoria Park, in which there were considerable deposits of offensive mud and the water was in a very dirty state, Much dissatisfaction has been expressed, at intervals during the year, respecting the quantity and quality of the water supply. I have examined the water of the East London and New River Companies on many occasions, and always found it bright and wholesome when drawn from the main, but often the reverse when drawn from cisterns or water butts. Dr. Letheby reported that the amount of organic matter in the water supplied by these Companies was very small, the average in the New River water being about the thirtieth part of a grain per gallon and in the East London rather more than the sixteenth part of a grain per gallon. This quantity could not exercise any appreciable prejudicial influence on the health of those who drank it unfiltered, although on reading the Reports of the Registrar General many persons might think that the words 30 "previous sewage contamination" mean that the water contained sewage matters, and was unfit for use. I refer to this matter here, as I believe much injury has been done by the use of these words. A very important Act was passed this year called the Metropolis "Water Act, 1871, by which the Companies are required, after the month of April, 1872, to provide a constant supply of water to such parts of their districts as the Metropolitan authority (the Metropolitan Board of Works) shall require and make application to the Companies requesting suoh supply. The Companies are however not bound to give it in a less period than four months after the service of a notice requiring them so to do. nor unless four-fifths of the premises comprised within the district mentioned in the notice, shall be provided within two months from the time of the service of the said order or notice, with the fittings prescribed by the Company. The word constant supply means a constant supply to a cistern capable of holding one days consumption of water, and to a pipe provided with a screw-down stop valve, the latter supply to be used for drinking and cooking. It is further provided that no Company shall be compelled to give a constant supply to any promises until they are provided with the prescribed fittings, or to continue it if the fittings get out of order, and that any person who shall "cause or suffer any fittings to be out of repair, or to be so used or contrived as that the water supplied to him by such Company is or is likely to be wasted, misused, unduly consumed or contaminated, or so as to occasion or allow the return of foul air or other noisome or impure matter into any pipe belonging to or connected with the pipes of such Company, he shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds." There is also an additional provision that the Company may under these circumstances cut off the supply and give notice thereof to the Sanitary authority for the district. 31 By the 33rd Section the absence of the prescribed fittings after the prescribed time shall be deemed a nuisance rendering the house unfit for human habitation. There are many other important sections which I need not mention here. In addition to the summonses under the Sanitary Act already mentioned, I obtained orders against many owners of property for neglecting to remove nuisances in accordance with notices served under the Nuisances Removal Act, and for offences against the Metropolis Local Management Act. Penalties were inflicted on the owner of a Dust-yard for allowing accumulations of vegetable and other refuse to remain on his premises; on several persons for keeping swine, so as to be a nuisance; on a person for retaining large quantities of soot in an uncovered yard; on the owner of a house for not re-constructing the drains in accordance with the order of the Board; on another person for having let his house without having first provided a proper water closet and water supply thereto; and also on an owner of houses for not repairing them in accordance with the Magistrates' order. One person who refused to pay the penalty ordered by the Magistrate, was committed to prison for fourteen days. I have attended during the year fifty meetings of the Sanitary Committee, or of Sub-Committees thereof, and many meetings of other Committees. The meetings and inspections of the Cow-house Committee generally occupied a whole day at a time, as many as from forty to fifty places being sometimes inspected in one day. Many were visited twice or three times in consequence of the works ordered to be done not having been carried out to the satisfaction of the Committee and the Sanitary Officers. The Cow-house Committee successfully opposed the granting of Licenses to three slaughter-houses and four cow-sheds, because the premises were not put into such order as to be satisfactory. 32 As however all the persons but two eventually did the necessary works, five of the Licences were granted on the adjourned day. There were fewer cases of iudecent overcrowding discovered this year than last, although some of them were very bad. For instance, in one room in the Templar Road the inspector found the father, mother, two grown up daughters, and a son aged fifteen, living and sleeping in one small room; in a small room in Tottenham Square the father, mother, a grown up daughter and two young children slept in one bed; in one room of a house in Wharf Road, not large enough for two grown up persons, there slept the father, mother, a son of twenty, a daughter of seventeen, and a boy and girl under ten years. A worse case came undpr our notice in Cottage Place, Well Street, where the father, mother, eight children, a grown up unmarried daughter who was in the family way, and a young man lodger, lived and slept in one room : Small Pox broke out in the family, spread to the young man and caused his death. At Frederick Terrace, Stonebridge Common, we found occupying a room, which was only large enough for two grown up persons and one child, the father, mother, two grown up daughters, and two girls under twelve years. Another bad case occurred in George Street near the London Fields, where the father and four daughters occupied only one room and one bed, their ages being seventeen, fifteen, twelve and nine years of age. In a lodging house consisting of four small rooms only, we found four families and several young coloured men lodgers, the total number of inmates being seventeen. The inspector found one room in the Blackstone Road occupied as a living and sleeping room by a man, his wife, an unmarried female lodger, and two children; and in another room in West Street, the father, mother, a girl of sixteen, a boy of thirteen, and four girls under twelve years of age. There were discovered altogether no less 38 than fourteen cases of indecent overcrowding, and thirty four other instances in which the number of inhabitants was decidedly in excess of that allowed by our Regulations. I cannot conclude the report without expressing much satisfaction with the manner in which my instructions have been carried out by the Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors.
