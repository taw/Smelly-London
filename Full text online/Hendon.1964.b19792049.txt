Young, M.B.E. 1. 2. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1964 To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hendon. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health cannot be submitted in its final form until confirmation of a number of statistics is received from the Registrar General. However, in view of the fact that the Borough of Hendon will no longer exist after the 1st April, 1964 I have prepared a report based on information now available (Part I), and a further report (Part II) will be submitted at a later date. The Reorientation of Local Government towards the London Borough of Barnet has allowed no time for those investigations which add to the interest of the Medical Officer of Health's report, and the report is therefore necessarily brief. In the decade since I came to Hendon there has been much progress in Public Health. The most noticeable highlight has been the disappearance of poliomyelitis, not only of poliomyelitis but also of the fear which many parents suffered of this disease. The air is now much cleaner than a few years ago, and the green smogs have been replaced by white mists. Standards have been raised in food hygiene and especially in personal hygiene, which is now so much improved that outbreaks of food borne disease are more likely to be due to faulty processes rather than to the failure of individual personal hygiene. In the ten-year period housing- has improved enormously, but it is not without some feeling of nostalgia that one has watched the demolition of many old cottages, so that few if any of the quaint cottages of the eighteenth century now remain in Hendon. On the debit side, lung cancer has increased and is still increasing, with its frightening toll of men in their fifth and sixth decades. Road traffic accidents are now responsible for more unhappiness than infectious disease; and we still sit back and watch the progress made in America towards the prevention of dental decay by the fluoridation of drinking water. In Hendon I have been fortunate in having an excellent staff, and an interested Public Health Committee, and I shall watch with interest the progress of the London Borough of Barnet. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies & Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J.L. PATTON Medical Officer of Health > SECTION A: STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OP THE AREA GENERAL WARDS (9) AREA IN ACRES Edgware 2,327 Burnt Oak 477 Mill Hill 2,695 West Hendon 1,143 Central 1,139 Park 580 Golders Green 748 Garden Suburb 669 Childs Hill 593 Area of the Borough 10,371 Population figures supplied by Registrar General 150,200* Density of population, i.e. number of persons per acre 14.48 Number of inhabited houses at 30th September 1964 (according to Rate Bock) 45,38l Average number of persons per house 3.31 Rateable value as at 30th September 1961 £11,359,763 Sum represented by a Penny Rate 45,770 *Population as at June 1963 3.

During the year 5 burials were carried out, 4 adults and 1 child. GENERAL HOSPITAL FACILITIES Edgware General Hospital. Colindale Hospital. Hendon District Hospital. The needs for mental treatment are served by Napsbury Hospital. INFECTIOUS DISEASES-HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION West Hendon Hospital. Neasden Isolation Hospital, Willesden. Any other Infectious Disease Hospital controlled by the North-Western Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT AND HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION Edgware General Hospital. Colindale Hospital. Admissions are normally made through the Chest Clinic, but in an emergency any chest case may be admitted to Colindale Hospital by the general practitioner phoning the hospital direct. The Chest Clinic at Edgware serves primarily those living in the Borough of Hendon and the Stanmore, Queensbury and Kingsbury districts of Harrow and Wembley. HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL The following services are provided by the Middlesex County Council under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946:- *Care of mothers and young children (Section 22) *Midwives Service (Section 23) *Health Visiting (Section 24) *Home Nursing (Section 25) *Vaccination and Immunisation (Section 26) 10. *Chiropody Service (Section 28) *Domestic Help (Section 29) School Health Services and Dental Services (Provided under Education Act, 1944, the Borough of Hendon "being an Excepted District). *These services are administered on an area basis, Area 4 consisting of the Boroughs of Hendon and Finchley. The Area Health Committee acts as a Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the County Council and consists of representatives of the two Boroughs, Middlesex County Council, certain professional bodies and other persons with special knowledge of these services. MEDICAL PRACTITIONER SERVICE AMD CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS The Middlesex Executive Committee has four categories, viz:Designated, Open, Intermediate and Restricted Areas. The present classifications of the different wards of the Boroi^gh are as follows:- (1) Open Areas-Burnt Oak, Childs Hill, Garden Suburb Mill Hill and West Hendon. Applications from doctors to enter practice in areas classified as Designated or Open will be granted automatically on the completion of their arrangements. (2) Intermediate Areas-Central. In this area the number of patients on the average general practitioner's list is reasonable. New practices may be established in such areas but the initial practice allowance is not likely to be paid. (3) Restricted Areas-Edgware, Golders Green and Park. These are areas in which the number of doctors is adequate. Normally applications by doctors to start new practices are not granted. LABORATORY FACILITIES These are provided at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. Specimens may be sent direct to the Laboratory by medical practitioners or by special collection from the Public Health Department provided they are received not later than 3.30 p.m. Monday to Friday. I would like to express my appreciation of the work carried out by the staff at the Laboratory who, during the course of the year, have given considerable advice and help to the Public Health Department. The number of samples taken in respect of milk, ice cream, domestic water supplies and swimming pools is shown elsewhere in the report. 11. SECTION D: SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OP THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough has a dual source of supply. The northern part is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and the central and southern portion by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Colne Valley Water is derived from wells sunk into the chalk and before distribution to the consumers the water is under constant supervision of a chemical and "bacteriological staff which carries out examinations in modern laboratories situated at the works. The water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board is selected Thames water which has been subjected to purification by storage in which time it is freed of the bulk of organisms. It is filtered through rapid and then slow filters, attaining a degree of purity which compares favourably with the general supplies in Great Britain, but as a further safeguard terminal chlorination is applied which ensures a first class water in every respect. Samples of water are examined bacteriologically, chemically and for taste and other special purposes on every day. The supply to all areas was satisfactory in quality and quantity. Number of dwelling houses supplied from public water mains:- (a) Direct to houses 45,381 (b) by means of standpipes Nil Number of population supplied from public water mains:- (a) Direct to houses 150,200 (b) by means of standpipes Nil Natural fluoride content of water supplies:- Colne Valley Water Company: Fluoride content-less than 0.1 parts per million Metropolitan Water Board: Fluoride content-0.25 parts per million. The water supplied to Hendon is deficient in fluoride and dental decay is more prevalent here than in those areas where the element is present in optimum quantity. 12. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTIONS The following inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors during the year:- Number of Inspections Re-inspections General Public Health Inspections Dwelling-houses (in connection with defects or insanitary conditions) 1,463 2,347 Caravans 89 167 Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957) 3 6 Cesspools 82 97 Drain Tests 151 100 Drainage and Plumbing Works 351 1,128 Overcrowding 22 12 Pests 218 192 Vermin 287 57 Atmospheric Pollution Smoke Observations.

CARAVANS CARAVAN SITES & CONTROL OF DEVELOPMENT ACT-1960 There is now only one licensed caravan site in the Borough. This is at a site at Brockley Hill, Stanmore, and is for one caravan only. Inspections showed that the conditions of the licence were being observed. DRAIN TESTS AND DRAINAGE WORKS Test of drainage systems and examination of sanitary fitments were carried out and reports submitted thereon during the year as follows:- For prospective purchasers of properties 6 In connection with applications for advances under the Housing (F.P.) Act 1958 113 Fees are paid to the Council for this work. In addition 12 tests of drainage systems were carried out in connection with the investigation of nuisances. CLEARANCE OF BLOCKED DRAINS The Council continues to operate its service for the clearing of drains at private premises, where this can be done by rodding or plunging, on request by owner or occupier. The charges for this work are as follows: During normal working hours 15. 0d. Evenings-Monday to Friday £1.10. Od. At week-ends £3. 0. Od. The use made of this service continues to grow, no less than 1208 drains being cleared during the year. Fifty-six were cleared at week-ends. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL During the year the Council provided a sewer to serve the Burton Hole Lane, N.W.7. area. By the end of the year connection of the drains from properties in the range of the sewer was proceeding steadily, and by then some 18 cesspools had been abolished. Parts of Mill Hill, Elstree and Barnet Gate remain unsewered, 129 properties being served by cesspools or small septic tank sewage disposal installations. 325 requests for the emptying of the cesspools or septic tanks were complied with, the work, in most instances, being carried out at the Council's expense. 16. LOCAL LAND CHARGES ENQUIRIES During the year, enquiries were received from the Town Clerk in respect of 3,800 properties. These related to any action "being taken under the Public Health, Housing and Rent Acts, inclusion in Smoke Control and in Housing Areas (areas scheduled for redevelopment). The necessary enquiries or inspections were made and the information supplied. PEST AND VERMIN CONTROL Each year sees an increasing number of requests from housewives for advice on the identification of insects they come across in their homes and on the method of eradication and control. Many of these insects are of little or no public health significance but in every case steps are taken to supply the appropriate information and advice, and if necessary the premises are visited and an inspection carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. The incidence of vermin (bugs, fleas and lice) is now very low, only fourteen infestations having to be dealt with. In these cases disinfestation work is carried out by one of the Council's rodent operatives who has been trained in this work. Wasps nests are also destroyed, free of charge, 301 being dealt with during the year. Routine inspections of the effects of new Council tenants are also carried out prior to their removal into their new accommodation, but it is now only very occasionally that any evidence of vermin is found. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT 1949-RODENT CONTROL Details of the work carried out during the year, in the form required by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food, is set out in Appendix II. DISINFECTION Disinfection of rooms by the use of formalin spray is carried out after the incidence of certain notifiable infectious diseases and, in case of tuberculosis, when considered necessary by the Chest Physician. Bedding, clothing and library books are disinfected by arrangement with Finchley Borough Council at their disinfecting station at North Circular Road, London, N.3. Parcels of clothing to be sent abroad are disinfected on request and an appropriate accompanying certificate issued. During the year the following were dealt with:- Rooms 23 Bedding and/or clothing 14l Library books 80 Parcels of clothing to be sent abroad 24 17. DOMICILIARY LAUNDRY SERVICE One of the problems which arises in the case of aged and sick persons in their own homes, is the cleansing and laundering of soiled linen and clothing. Where such persons have no relative living with them who is able to deal with the articles, assistance is given under Section 84, Public Health Act, 1936, as amended by Section 42, Middlesex County Council Act, 1956. These sections give the Council necessary authority to have the articles collected and cleansed (laundered). During the year 13,104 articles were collected from the houses of 36 such incontinent persons. The articles are collected twice weekly and returned to them after laundering. FACTORIES ACT. 1961 At the request of the Ministry of Health the tables showing the work carried out in the administration of the health provisions of the Factories Acts, are given in the prescribed form as set out in Appendix I. PREMISES LICENSED FOR PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT In accordance with the usual annual procedure, inspections were made at the request of the Middlesex County Council of the sanitary conveniences, kitchen, etc., at hotels, church halls, cinemas, restaurants, etc., licensed for public entertainment. Thirty-eight premises were inspected. At twenty-five premises conditions were found to be satisfactory. At the other thirteen minor matters were found requiring attention and appropriate action was taken to deal with these. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 This Act and the Regulations made thereunder prescribe standards of cleanliness for each of certain specified filling materials used in the manufacture of furniture, prams, toys, etc. Premises at which the work is carried out are required to be registered with the Local Authority and records have to be kept showing the amounts etc., of the filling materials used. Five premises are registered with the Council. Each was inspected during the year and found to be conforming with the Act and Regulations. SWIMMING BATHS There are two municipal-owned open air swimming pools (one at Mill Hill and one at West Hendon) and one open air teaching swimming 18. pool at Broadfields Junior School. Samples of swimming bath water were taken during the summer months and submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination. The following are the results of the samples:- No. taken Results Mill Hill Swimming Bath 15 14 satisfactory 1 unsatisfactory West Hendon Swimming Bath 12 11 satisfactory 1 unsatisfactory Broadfields Junior School Swimming Pool 9 2 satisfactory 7 unsatisfactory There was no apparent cause for the one unsatisfactory sample at Mill Hill and West Hendon Baths, where the standard is normally very high. The samples from Broadfields Junior School showed little improvement on previous years. The following figures show the attendances at the two municipalowned baths during the opening season. West Hendon Mill Hill Adults 9,685 25,026 Children 27,652 80,301 Season Tickets 2,956 10,905 School Children under instruction- Middlesex County Council 8,367 14,933 Private - 752 48,660 131,917 PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 Eleven applications were received for the renewal of licences to keep pet shops, The "animals" kept included puppies, kittens, hamsters, guinea-pigs, rabbits, birds, mice, fish and reptiles.

HEALTH & WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT. 1956 Inspections were made during the year of the thirteen farms and other agricultural or horticultural premises in the Borough to ensure that the requirements of the Act relating to the provision and maintenance of suitable sanitary conveniences for the use of the workers, were being complied with. At four premises works of cleansing, redecoration or repair were found to be necessary. The appropriate notices were served and the works executed. At the other nine premises conditions were found to be satisfactory. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACTS Foot and Mouth Disease Swine Fever No outbreaks of these diseases in or near the Borough during the year so that it did not become necessary at any time to place restrictions on the movement of animals. Fowl Pest No cases of this disease occurred in the Borough during the year, nor was it necessary for any restriction on movement to be imposed. THE MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS (RECORDS) ORDERS. 1950 & 196l Detailed records have to be kept by stockholders of the movement of bovines, sheep, goats and pigs to and from their premises.
