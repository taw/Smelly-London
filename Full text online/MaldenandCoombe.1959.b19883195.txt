Ac 4413(1) Borough of Malden and Coombe Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health AND THE Chief Public Health Inspector FOR THE YEAR 1959 3. 5. Library. S. Raw 2)Region London BOROUGH OF MALDEN AND COOMBE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1959 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. August, 1960. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1959 which has been prepared in accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/60. It is perhaps appropriate that I should introduce my first report by mentioning one or two of the trends which are likely to influence the work of the Public Health Department in the future. As knowledge is increased we can expect a growing awareness of factors in the environment which affect health and which will enable preventive action to be taken. Thus realisation of the harmful effects of atmospheric pollution has made it possible for local authorities in affected areas to take action directed towards the elimination of this hazard. This is an immense task and one which, to be successfully carried out, will need concerted action by all those district authorities who are constituents of the great towns and cities. The lead given by those authorities who have already used their powers under the Clean Air Act must be followed by others if full benefit is to be gained. Information is being vigorously sought in many parts of the world as to the relative significance of the many and varied atmospheric pollutants which are the products of modern life. Much remains to be done. The elimination of smoke and soot is the first step towards a healthy atmosphere. The hazard of radioactivity presents a national and international problem but with the increasing use of radioactive isotopes in industrial processes there is a very real need for local knowledge and supervision of sources of radioactivity. For this to be effective it will be necessary for Public Health staff to be adequately trained in this new science so that they can carry out their task of protecting the health of the community they serve. 2. The modem legislative attitude towards the mentally disabled directs attention to community rather than institutional care. This may have a not inconsiderable effect upon the housing requirements of affected families. Their accommodation may be inadequate or of an unsuitable type for the care of a mentally disabled person. Tuberculosis deaths continue to diminish steadily in number and also notifications of new cases, though to a less degree. It will be many years before this disease disappears completely during which preventive measures to control the spread of infection will still be required, indeed a redoubled effort may prove to be necessary in the final stage. These are but a few of the matters which seem likely to become of increasing importance in the next decade. The vital statistics included in the report are satisfactory and compare favourably with the country as a whole. The work of the department has proceeded efficiently and I am grateful to the staff for their willingness and co-operation. I would like also to record my sincere appreciation for the hospitable welcome extended to me by members of the Council, Chief Officers and their staffs in my new appointment. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Tour obedient servant, P. WESTCOMBE. Medical Officer of Health. 3. PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Acute Poliomyelitis. For the first tine for many years no case of poliomyelitis was notified in the district. The vaccination campaign against this disease was intensified and by the end of the year it was estimated that over of the eligible population was protected. Mention should be made of the special "Vaccination Week" which was held in June. Vaccination was made freely available at Clinics and at a Mobile Vaccination Centre held in a Civil Defence vehicle adapted for the purpose which operated at Railway Stations and other focal points. Thousands of leaflets were distributed by voluntary workers from local organisations, while posters were displayed in shops and other business premises. Particular tribute should be paid to the Civil Defence Officer and volunteers, the staff of the Public Health Department and the members of the British Red Cross Society, St. John Ambulance Brigade, Women's Voluntary Services and all those others who gave unstintingly of their time and effort to ensure the success of the campaign. Nearly 1,000 persons in the district received their first injections during the week. Diphtheria. The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year:- Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 432, school 72) 504 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 713 Although diphtheria is no longer a serious public health problem it must be remembered that the disease is still present and that any relaxation of the immunisation campaign could have serious results. Immunisation not only prevents many children from contracting diphtheria, but greatly mitigates the severity of the illness if a child should fall a victim to this disease. For the twelfth year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Immunisation against diphtheria progresses smoothly. Special efforts continue to be made to encourage mothers to bring their babies for immunisation in those cases where persuasion by the health visitor has failed. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. 4. Whooping Cough. The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 21. No deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which sure available. It is to be hoped that whooping cough immunisation will prove as effective as immunisation against diphtheria. Tetanus. Inoculation against tetanus has been available since 1956 and is now widely accepted. Althapgh not a common disease, the mortality rate is high and immunisation is recommended. 329 children were immunised during the year. Smallpox Vaccination. Vaccinations 418. Revaccinations 64. 482. Of the above, 206 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 375 of the persons vaccinated were under one year of age. The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate time. The percentage of infants under 1 year vaccinated in this Borough during the year was 75. 9%. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. Scarlet Fever. The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 33, giving an incidence rate of 0.73 per thousand population. All the cases were very mild. Measles. The number of cases of measles notified (385) was higher than in 1958. No deaths occurred. 5. Dysentery. 88 cases of the mild sonne dysentery occurred. This condition is highly infectious among young children and its incidence has been increasing during the past few years throughout the country. Although this illness is mild it is responsible for significant loss of school time among affected children and contacts and rigid methods of control are necessary to prevent epidemic spread. Food Poisoning. There were 2 single cases of food poisoning, both due to salmonella typhi-murium. STATISTICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS Area 3 . 164 acres.

The Council's mortuary is still closed and the arrangements continued with the Wimbledon Borough Council for bodies to be received in the mortuary at Gap Road, Wimbledon. 39 bodies were received in the mortuary. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. Section 47. It was not necessary to take action under this Act for the removal to hospital of any case during the year. Preventive work is constantly carried out for old people brought to the notice of the Public Health Department as being possibly in need of care and attention. 48 such cases were visited by the Public Health Nurse in 1959 and in all cases it was found possible to maintain the old people either in their own homes with the help of the various Statutory and Voluntary Services available, or by gaining their voluntary admission to hospital or to County Welfare Homes. Section 50. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it was necessary during the year to arrange for two burials. 15.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR 1959 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. August, 1960. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my 7th annual report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year. At the November meeting the Council gave careful consideration to the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, and it was decided to make the whole Borough smoke controlled over a period of twelve years by a series of Smoke Control Orders. This will necessitate additional staff to deal with the great amount of extra work involved and I hope to receive the co-operation of all concerned in the implementation of these measures which will bring great benefit. As mentioned in the body of my report a new form of Improvement Grant was introduced during the year. These "Standard Grants" are available as of right for the provision of certain modern amenities and the procedure for obtaining them is quite simple. The original Improvement Grants, which are given entirely at the discretion of the Council, have been renamed "Discretionary Grants" and are still available up to a maximum of £400. Mr. R. M. Borlase, Public Health Inspector, resigned on the 18th October, 1959, and the Council was not able to fill this vacancy until the 25th April, 1960. This seriously affected the work of the department particularly in view of the constantly increasing volume of work. Mr. J. T. Thompson resigned on the 31st August, 1959, to become a Pupil Public Health Inspector with a neighbouring authority. 17. I regret to record the death of Mr. A. E. Wilson, Rodent Operative, who had been an employee of the Council for 31 years. In conclusion, I would express my appreciation of the support given by members of the Council, my thanks to colleagues in this and other departments and in particular to Dr. P. Westcombe, Medical Officer of Health, for the happy relationship which has existed since he came to Maiden and Coombe during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen said Councillors, Your obedient servant, S. J. T. WOOD. Chief Public Health Inspector. 18. HOUSING The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year - (a) by the Council 60 (b) by private enterprise. 118 Number of houses in course of construction - (a) by the Council 111 (b) by private enterprise. 92 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served - Preliminary 35 Abatement 17 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT. 1959 The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, came into operation on the 14th June, 1959, and provides for an extension and simplification of the existing system of improvement grants. A new form of grant - the Standard Grant - was introduced whereby grants became available for the cost of installing a bath, water closet in or contiguous to the building, hot water system, wash hand basin and satisfactory facilities for storing food in a dwelling without one or more of those facilities. Subject to the dwelling being likely to remain fit for human habitation for not less than 15 years and the applicant having a freehold or leasehold interest, of which not less than 15 years remains unexpired, the local authority must approve a grant. The maximum amount of Standard Grant, which is 50% of the cost of carrying out the work, shall not exceed £155 if all the following facilities are provided. The maximum amount of grant payable for each facility is as follows: Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom £25 Wash hand basin £5 Hot water supply £75 Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling £40 Satisfactory facilities for storing food £10 19. On completion, the dwelling must possess all the amenities. The Council will continue to operate the improvement grant system which has been used since the passing of the Housing Act, 1949. This form of grant was renamed "Discretionary Grant" and will be given entirely at the discretion of the Council for works of improvement or conversion up to a cost of£800 and subject to a grant up to 50% of this cost. Generally speaking Discretionary Grants are given where more extensive work is necessary to provide modern amenities, for example, the construction of a bathroom extension to an existing house. During the year numerous enquiries were made by ratepayers and advice was given. The following tables show the number of grants approved and payments made during the year: Standard Grants.

In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical, examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. One water sample was taken on receipt of a complaint, the report on which was satisfactory. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The following disinfections were carried out: Tuberculosis 5 rooms. Other infectious diseases 2 rooms. Seven bags of clothing were disinfected. 68 rooms were disinfested for insect pests. 1 pond was treated for mosquitoes. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 1955 During the year 157 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. ARTICLES. ANALYSED.

The Public Analyst reported that it had a rancid taste and smell, and pointed out a technical offence in the labelling of this product. This is a product with a limited shelf life and the manufacturer and the retailer were informed of their responsibilities. The manufacturer immediately arranged to have the label suitably amended. Pork Luncheon Meat. (Two informal samples). The Public Analyst reported that the meat contents of 62% and 65% respectively were not sufficient to justify the description "Pork Luncheon Meat". In each case the matter was taken up with the importers who undertook not to import further supplies from the manufacturer unless the meat content was at least 80% 25. Starch Reduced Bread, (informal sample). The Public Analyst reported that the reduction in starch was insignificant and arose only by the addition of protein in the form of gluten. The manufacturers agreed to amend the wording of their labels. Pre-fluffed Rice. (informal sample). The Public Analyst reported that the label on the imported product did not specify the minimum quantity of vitamins per ounce in the manner prescribed by the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. The importers made immediate arrangements to amend the labels of the existing stock and for future shipments to have the labels corrected in the country of origin. Pork Sausage Meat, (informal sample). The Public Analyst reported that the sausage meat contained Sulphur Dioxide as an added preservative. A notice stating the sausage meat contained preservative was not visible in the shop at the time of purchase, but on further inspection it was found that the requisite notice was covered by a charity collection sock. A warning letter was sent to the retailer. Crisp Bread, (informal sample). The Public Analyst considered that the label was misleading in claiming that their crisp bread was a slimming food and, after correspondence with the manufacturers, the label was amended. MILK During the year the following licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designations)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, or the Milk (Special Designations)(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949-1954. Dealers. Tuberculin tested 8. Pasteurised 10. Sterilised 11. Supplementary, Tuberculin tested 10. Pasteurised 10. Sterilised 11. 26. The difference between a dealer's and a supplementary licence is that, if a dairyman has premises in a local government area where he retails milk he is issued with a dealer's licence. Should he retail milk in another area he must obtain a supplementary licence from the Council of that area. DETAILS OF MILK TESTING CLASS OF MILK NUMBER OF SAMPLES TESTED APPROPRIATE TESTS NUMBER OF SAMPLES PASSED FAILED Pasteurised 41 Phosphatase 40 1 Methylene blue 41 - Sterilised 6 Turbidity 6 - Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 18 Phosphatase 18 - Methylene blue 18 - The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that ell pathogenic organisms have been eliminated.

A loaf of bread contained foreign matter and the Public Analyst reported that it consisted of a cooked dough substance slightly contaminated and discoloured by very finely divided particles of iron and possibly a trace of oil. The quantity present was minute and quite harmless. This had evidently originated from the machinery and a warning letter was sent to the bakers. A further complaint was received concerning a loaf supplied by the same bakers. Proceedings were instituted in this case and and defendants were fined £10 with £3. 3. 0. costs. A piece of metal found in a loaf of bread was identified as a piece of broken belt coupling from the bakehouse machinery. A warning letter was sent to the baker and attention was drawn to the necessity for regular inspection of the plant. Another complaint was received of foreign matter in a loaf of bread and the Public Analyst reported that it consisted of numerous minute black particles which had the characteristics of general atmospheric dust and dirt but a considerable proportion consisted of unburnt carbon of a sooty nature. Proceedings were instituted and the bakery company was fined £20 and £5. 5. 0. costs. Biscuits. Mould growth was found in biscuits and the matter was taken up with the manufacturers and it appeared that the trouble had arisen through a defective joint in the tin and the biscuits had become damp. A warning letter was sent to the manufacturers. 29. Pork Pie. A complaint was received of mould growth in a port pie sold from a public house. A warning letter was sent to the retailer concerned. Milk. A complaint was received of foreign matter in a bottle of school milk. This was identified as black crayon similar to crayon used at the school and no action was taken. Tinned Vegetables. A school canteen supervisor complained of an acrid odour given off in cooking mixed diced vegetables including carrots, turnips and swedes. The food was surrendered and destroyed. The Public Analyst examined samples and reported that there was some abnormality in the taste of the turnip. He also stated that an abnormal bitter flavour in turnips and some other root crops is not uncommon. Sausage. A complaint was received of foreign matter in a sausage. This was identified as bakelite and a warning letter was sent to the manufacturers. Pork Pie. A complaint was received of mould growth in a pork pie, but having regard to all the circumstances a warning letter was sent to the retailer. A number of complaints relating to milk and other foods were referred to the districts concerned. ICE CREAM Thirty-eight samples were submitted to the methylene blue test and all were placed in grade I. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 Per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade I, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". 30. The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947:- Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade IV % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 - 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 - 1952 76 71 93.4 5 60.6 0 - 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 - 1957 54 54 100.0 0 - 0 - 1958 56 56 100.0 0 - 0 - 1959 38 38 100.0 0 - 0 - It is pleasing to note that for the second year all samples reached the high standard of grade I. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT. As the Council appoints an analyst for the purposes of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. These are administered by my department. Inspections were made but it was not necessary to take any action during the year. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT. 1952 This Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year but in all cases the appliances inspected were satisfactory. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951. One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These sure premises where upholstery work is carried on. Two samples were submitted to the Prescribed Analyst who gave a satisfactory report on each. 31. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT. 1950 There are 380 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation. Where plans are submitted of new construction or alteration to shop premises, due consideration is given to ensure that the proposals comply with the provisions of the Act. The Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the administration of the law relating to shop hours, including early closing and Sunday trading. One hundred and fifty-four inspections were made during the year which revealed that the arrangements made for the health and comfort of shop workers were in the majority of cases satisfactory. Most of the necessary action taken was in connection with the exhibiting of notices and the sale from shops of prohibited goods on the early closing day and Sunday mornings. REFUSE TIP Carshalton and the Merton and Morden Urban District Councils continued to tip clinker and screenings at the rear of Green Lane School, Worcester Park, for the purpose of raising the ground level for playing fields. The site was visited frequently during the year and the only nuisance experienced was from an infestation of flies during October. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION The obligations of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, have been fully met. The work of rats and mice destruction continues on a well organised basis, providing a free service to householders and making appropriate charges in the case of business premises, many of which are on annual service agreements. The Borough river boundaries, depots, disused refuse tips, piggeries and open spaces have received constant attention, also the premises of The Hogsmill Valley Joint Sewerage Board. 32. Several small sections of the sewers were treated for minor infestations. Liaison is maintained with officers of the infestation division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Workable Area Committee meetings were held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of rodent control were discussed. INSECT PESTS As in previous years the department was able to be of assistance by giving advice and help to members of the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests. Considerable nuisance was experienced from wasps during the very warm dry summer and the department gave all possible assistance and advice, in fact 243 wasp nests were destroyed and the cost of work was recovered from the occupiers. The carpet beetle, clover mite and ant continued to be most troublesome. Six rooms were treated for infestations of bugs and 22 rooms for fleas. Twenty-five council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council seven school kitchens and canteens were sprayed with a residual insecticide as a deterrent against insect infestation. CARAVANS There are no caravan sites in the Borough. Licences were granted to station one moveable dwelling in the area. PUBLIC SEWERS Stoppages in public sewers (combined drains) were cleared by the department on two hundred and sixty-two occasions. In a few instances the assistance of sewermen from the Borough Engineer's department had to be obtained.

In November the Council decided to proceed with making Smoke Control Orders which would apply to the whole of the Borough at the end of twelve years. Thirteen Smoke Control Areas have been planned and subject to the availability of staff it is the Council's intention to deal with three areas before the end of 1963, as follows: (1) 1961 Area No.1 . Coombe Hill area bounded by Kingston Hill, Kingston Vale, Beverley Brook, Coombe Hill Road, Coombe Lane and Warren Road. (2) 1962 Area No.2. Maiden Golf Course area bounded by Coombe Hill Road, Beverley Brook, Main Railway Line, Coombe Road and Traps Lane. (3) 1963 Area No.3. Maiden Hill area bounded by Main Railway Line, Beverley Brook, Maiden Way and Maiden Road. Atmospheric Pollution. During the year numerous complaints were received concerning oily smuts being deposited on washing and paintwork of houses in the vicinity of a factory in the district. Expert advice was obtained and the Company concerned and their staff co-operated whole-heartedly in remedial measures which have so far proved to be satisfactory - the sheathing in aluminium of the 100 ft. stack. The method of remedying this nuisance is of particular interest as this stack was the highest in the country to be so treated. During the year 64 visits were made in connection with smoke abatement. The following tables show the daily average, and highest and lowest concentrations of smoke expressed in milligrammes per 100 cubic metres and sulphur dioxide concentration as parts per 100 million volumes of air for the years 1958 and 1959.
