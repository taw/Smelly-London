PLON 72 120 CORPORATION OF LONDON PORT HEALTH AUTHORITY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH To 31st DECEMBER, 1964 CONSTITUTION AND JURISDICTION The governing body of the City of London, the Corporation of London, was originally constituted the Sanitary Authority of the Port of London by Section 20 of the Public Health Act, 1872. The cost of administration was met from the Corporation's private funds for close on fifty years, when it became rate (and grant) aided. By the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the term "Port Sanitary" was changed to "Port Health", and the Port Health district is further defined by that Act as the "Port of London as established for the purposes of the law relating to the Customs of the United Kingdom" and by the Public Health Act, 1936 as "the Port as established for the purposes of the enactments relating to the Customs". The limits of the Port Health District of the Port of London were originally defined by a Treasury Minute dated 1st August, 1883. They commence at high water mark in the River Thames at Teddington Lock, in the County of Surrey, and extend down both sides of the said River Thames to an imaginary straight line drawn from the Pilot mark at the entrance of Havengore Creek in the County of Essex, to the Land's End at Warden Point, in the Isle of Sheppey, in the County of Kent, such point being the north-western limit of the Port of Faversham, and extend up and include both sides of the River Medway to an imaginary straight line drawn from the south-east point of land westward of Coalmouth Creek, thence across the said River Medway to the western-most point of the piece of land which forms the eastern side of Stangate Creek, or, in other words, the north-west point of Fleet Marsh and thence in a southerly direction to Iwade Church in the said County of Kent, and thence in a north-easterly direction to Elmley Chapel in the said Isle of Sheppey, a supposed direct line from Elmley Chapel to Iwade Church, being the western limit of the Port of Faversham, and the said Port of London includes the Islands of Havengore Creek aforesaid, called Potton and Rushley Islands, and so much of the said Creek and Watercourses as extends from it to the town of Rochford, and also includes all other Islands, Rivers, Streams, Creeks, Waters, Watercourses, Channels, Harbours, Docks and places within the before-mentioned limits contained. The Port of London Authority with which the Port Health Authority works in close cooperation, was established as the administrative body of the Port of London including the docks and tideway of the River Thames, by Act of Parliament in 1909. January, 1965 To: THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COMMONERS OF THE CORPORATION OF LONDON. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit as Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1964. A letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Health, dated November, 1963, indicated that the Medical Officer of Health should prepare his Annual Report in Accordance with Form Port 20. Paragraph 5 of this Form reads as follows:- "The information required by Sections I, V, VI, VIII, XIV and XVI, which has been given in an earlier report and has not since changed, need not be repeated each year. A recapitulation of all information should be made in the Report for the years 1952 and 1955 and thereafter quinquennially. For the intermediate years, only the changes which have occurred during the year covered by the Report need be mentioned in those Sections; if there is no change "No Change" should be entered". This Report has been prepared in accordance with the above directive. The following is a summary of the principal items mentioned:— Shipping The number of vessels arriving in the Port of London during 1964 was 57,619, 37,191 from foreign ports and 20,428 coastwise. The total tonnage of these vessels was 93,071,179 net tons as compared with 47.276.251 net tons in 1963. The Boarding Medical Officers visted 1,466 vessels from foreign ports and 6 coastwise ships. The Port Health Inspectors made 15,880 inspections of vessels, 13,038 of which were foreign going, 2,155 coastwise and 687 inland navigation. Water Supplies Regular sampling of water supplies for ships was continued during the year and an incident of contaminated water from an hydrant and delivery hose was dealt with. Communicable Diseases 222 cases of notifiable and other infectious diseases were reported as having occurred on 155 vessels. 143 of these cases were dealt with in the Port. 89 cases were admitted to various hospitals, including 40 to the Port Isolation Hospital at Denton, near Gravesend. Full precautionary measures were taken in respect of a ship reported to have landed a case of smallpox abroad and of one having a recovered case of smallpox aboard. Precautionary measures were also taken in respect of three cases of typhoid fever. Rodent Control During the year 2,505 rats, 812 in ships and 1,693 in shore premises were destroyed in the Port of London. In addition 1,865 mice were destroyed, 151 in ships and 1,714 in shore premises 64 rats were examined for plague with negative results. 2,062 inspections of lighters for evidence of rodents were made. International Deratting and Deratting Exemption Certificates The number of deratting certificates issued to ships was 43, the method of deratting in 41 instances being poisoning with Sodium Fluoroacetate (1080) . 1,069 deratting exemption certificates were granted. Shellfish Due to the severe winter in 1963 the trade in Native Oysters has still not recovered but the Industry received an unexpected boost in the laying of Oysters from Portugal for fattening and subsequent re-exportation. Medical Inspection of Aliens and Commonwealth Immigrants During the year 82 aliens and 670 Commonwealth Immigrants were examined by the Medical Inspectors. The arrangements whereby the larger passenger ships are boarded by the Medical Inspectors with the Immigration Officers at Brixham was continued and worked effectively. Pigeon Control With the co-operation of the Port of London Authority and occupiers of dock premises systematic control measures were carried out to keep the pigeon population at a reasonable level. Canal Boats 4 inspections of canal boats were made during the year. No defects were found on these boats. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year 29 infringements were observed. A prosecution was taken in one case and was successful. Transport of Refuse by Lighters A few minor infringements of the bye-laws were noted. In one case successful legal proceedings were taken. Houseboats No difficulties were encountered during the year. 21 houseboats were licensed to be moored at Benfleet in accordance wjth the Essex County Council Act, 1952. Launches The launch "Alfred Robertson" which has been in continuous service for 26 years will be replaced by a new launch early in 1965. This will be a slightly larger vessel and will be capable of acting as relief, in cases of emergency, for the cutter "Humphrey Morris" on the Gravesend Boarding Station. Visitors and Students Visitors and students,, for the most part doctors, and public health inspectors, from many countries visited the Port for instructions in and demonstrations of port health work. Students for the Diploma examination for Public Health Inspectors were also taken for instruction in port health work. Food Hygiene (Dock Carriers, etc.) Regulations* 1960 During the year progress was made in raising the standard of hygienic handling of food cargoes and appreciable improvements achieved in the cleanliness of the vehicles used for the transport of food. Dangerous Drugs Thirty one certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1953. Imported Food The total amount of foodstuffs seized and condemned as unfit for human consumption and either reconditioned or disposed of for animal feeding or for industrial purposes under guarantee or destroyed or re-exported was 5,529 tons 15 cwts. 0 qrs. 2 lbs. as compared with 6,614 tons 10 cwts. 2 qrs. 22 lbs. in 1963. Fertiliser and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1926 Seven samples of Feeding Stuffs were submitted to the Agricultural Analyst. Finally, I wish to record appreciation of the collaboration and assistance rendered by Her Majesty's Customs, the Pilots, the Immigration Officers, the Port of London Authority, the Shipping Federation, the staffs of Shipping Companies and Merchants, the staffs of the Central Public Health Laboratory, the "Dreadnought" Seamen's Hospital and St. Andrew's Hospital, the Public Analyst, the Emergency Bed Service, the Regional Hospital Boards and Hospital Management Committees concerned, and all those who have so generously and willingly helped in every aspect of port health work throughout the year, particularly the Chairman, members and staff of the Port and City of London Health Committee.

The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. SECTION IV INLAND BARGE TRAFFIC Numbers and tonnage using the district and places served by the traffic. These barges are of all types and are registered annually with the Port of London Authority. They number approximately 7,000 and their tonnage is some 500,000. The traffic of these craft extends throughout the length of the Port while a number of them are employed carrying goods and merchandise via the canals to all parts of the country. SECTION V WATER SUPPLY 1. Source of supply for: (a) The District - No change (b) Shipping - No change 2. Reports of tests for contamination. The bacteriological examinations of fresh water samples has continued to be carried out by St. Andrew's Hospital, Bow, for the dock areas and River districts on the North bank and by the Devonport Pathological Laboratory, Greenwich, for the dock areas and River districts on the South bank, while the Public Health Laboratory at Maidstone has continued to examine samples from the Medway area. There was only one incident during the year of a contaminated hydrant and delivery hose supplying a vessel with impure water. On receipt of a telephone message from the laboratory indicating heavy faecal contamination found on the examination of a routine sample of water, preventative measures were immediately taken to isolate the affected hydrant and prohibit further use. The only vessel supplied from the hydrant was promptly advised at sea through the Owners and chlorination of the ship's fresh water storage and supplies were carried out in accordance with instructions contained in the 'Shipmaster's Medical Guide.' The hydrant pit, water meter, hoses and all equipment in the water trolley involved in the occurrence were thoroughly cleansed and sterilised by chlorination. Subsequent samples drawn from the hydrant and equipment were found to be pure and permission was given to resume water operations. 7 Three cases of gross contamination of drinking water on ships occurred during the year. These were attributed to the use of the wash-deck pipe line as a supply extension to reach the drinking water tank. The Shipping Companies concerned were notified and chlorination of storage tanks was carried out. Strong disapproval of this procedure has been expressed by the Authority on numerous occasions. The Ministry of Transport issued a circular No. M410-1957 to Shipowners and Masters deprecating any link between potable water supply lines and sea-water installation. Unfortunately, there are such occasions when this precept is ignored, usually as a matter of expediency mingled with ignorance. 3. Precautions taken against contamination of hydrants and hosepipes:— During the year the opportunity has been taken, whenever possible to reduce possible contamination of existing water mains and pits by more advantageous locations of the mains. During reconstruction work in the Docks and in keeping with modern practice, main services including fresh water mains are contained where possible in a concrete duct incorporated in the quay construction. Individual hydrant pits are not required in this system and therefore, the previous problems of cleaning, drainage and flood preventions associated with the older pits have been eliminated. The replacement of the old type water meter boxes by stand pipes incorporating a water meter has been initiated as renewals have become necessary. 4. Number and sanitary conditions of water boats and powers of control by the Authority:— There has been no change in the powers of control of water boats by this Authority and the general standard of cleanliness of the water-boats in service is very satisfactory. Every endeavour has been made to comply with the aims of the Code of Practice by the Port of London Authority and by personnel engaged in fresh water operations. The percentage of "Satisfactory," "Good" and "Excellent" samples was 95.71. This indicates the high standard of purity of drinking water supplied in the Port and that progress has been maintained.

List of infected areas— No change. 2. Radio messages— No change. 3. Notification otherwise than by radio— No change. 4. Mooring stations— No change. 5. Arrangements for — (a) Hospital accommodation for infectious disease (other than Smallpox — see Section VII)— No change. (b) Surveillance and follow up of contacts — No change. (c) Cleansing and disinfection of ships. persons, clothing and other articles -No change. The Public Health (Ships) (Amendment) Regulations, 1963, came into effect on 1st August, 1963. These regulations amend the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1952 to 1961 and enable port health officers to require the production of International Certificates of Vaccination against smallpox. If a person is not in possession of such a certificate he may be offered vaccination, and may be placed under surveillance or in isolation. SECTION VII SMALLPOX 1. Name of Isolation Hospital to which smallpox cases are sent from the District. Long Reach Hospital is situated on the south bank of the River Thames about eight miles above Gravesend. The hospital consists of 10 ward blocks capable of accommodating 170 patients but, except in cases of emergency, only three ward blocks (2 of 20 beds and 1, a cubicle ward of 10 beds), total 50 beds, are kept available for immediate use. The hospital includes residential quarters for the staff and a laundry, although the administration and staffing is carried out from Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford. 9 2. Arrangements for transport of such cases to that hospital by ambulance giving the name of the Authority responsible for the ambulance and the vaccinal state of the ambulance crews. A case or cases of smallpox would be removed from the vessel by this Authority's Ambulance launch and conveyed ashore via the pontoon at Denton and from thence conveyed by road ambulance direct to Long Reach Hospital. The Port Health Authority would be responsible for the vaccinal state of their Ambulance Launch crews, while the vaccinal state of the Road Ambulance personnel would be the concern of the South-east Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board under whose jurisdiction both Joyce Green and Long Reach Hospitals fall. 3. Names of smallpox consultants available. Dr. J.V. Armstrong Dr. H.S. Banks Dr. J.D. Kershaw Dr. W.J. Coughlan Dr. W.T.G. Boul Dr. J.P. Marsden Dr. A. Melvin Ramsay 4. Facilities for laboratory diagnosis of smallpox. Facilities are available at the Virus Laboratory at the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. Suspected Case of Smallpox on m.v. "JALAGANGA" The m.v. "Jalaganga" of Bombay arrived in London on 9th January from Tuticorin, Aden and Port Said. A steward was reported to have been ill during the voyage towards the end of December. The Boarding Medical Officer who saw the case on arrival believed that he had recovered from an illness which may have been smallpox. The Smallpox Consultant concurred in this diagnosis. The patient was removed to Denton Isolation Hospital and the vessel was given modified pratique and proceeded to Surrey Commercial Docks. Though the 57 members of the crew were in possession of valid International Vaccination Certificates they were revaccinated on the morning of 10th January as well as two Customs Officers and a ship's agent who had been detained on board the vessel overnight. The Medical Officer of Health, accompanied by the Boarding Medical Officer, then went to Denton Hospital to see the patient. The case was complicated by infected impetigo and eczema but there were scars and staining desquamation of a distribution consistent with healed modified smallpox. The Ministry of Health were informed of the diagnosis "a recovered case of suspected smallpox". After the crew were vaccinated the vessel was given free pratique, the crew being mustered daily for inspection until 14th January when the vessel sailed for Avonmouth, the Medical Officer of Health having been previously notified of the circumstances. Smallpox — Tanker "3 order Pele" On Wednesday, 15th April, 1964, information was received from the Ministry of Health that on 10th April, 1964, an Indian seaman was landed at Suez from m.v. "Border Pele" suffering from suspected smallpox. This diagnosis was later confirmed as smallpox. The Asian crew had joined the vessel at Bombay on 23rd March. The tanker left Mena al Ahmadi with a cargo of Gas Oil on 30th March. The patient felt slightly unwell on 5th April, and reported ill with a rash and tempperature on 6th April. He was considered to be suffering from chickenpox and isolated in the Ship's Hospital. On 10th April, he was seen by a Medical Officer at Suez and diagnosed as suffering from smallpox and landed. All the crew comprising 16 British Officers and 47 Asians were re-vaccinated. The m.v."Border Pele" was due at the Isle of Grain on 20th April and arrangements were made for her to be boarded at the Nore. On arrival off the Isle of Grain the vessel was anchored in the evening at the Nore and was boarded by the Medical Officer on duty from "Hygeia",two Port Health Inspectors and a Clerical Officer, together with the Medical Officer B.P. Refinery, at approximately 19.00 via the launch "Humphrey Morris". All the members of the crew were examined and re-vaccinated. The Port Health Inspectors disinfected the Ship's Hospital and the cabin occupied by the case, and disinfection of bedding etc. set under way, these being removed to the "Humphrey Morris" for transportation to Denton Hospital for disinfection. Surveillance particulars were taken of those going on leave before the ship went alongside her berth. Two Officers were found to have raised temperature and mild rash. It was decided to allow modified pratique and let the vessel proceed to her berth at No. 6 Jetty Isle of Grain and to enforce strict security on arrival. The Two Officers were re-examined on the 21st April and it was decided to remove them to Long Reach Isolation Hospital, Dartford, by arrangement with the Small-pox Consultant.The routine surveillance procedures were applied to the members of crew going home on leave as well as the crew detained on board, and disinfection completed. On surveillance on 23rd April, a member of Asian Crew was found to have a temperature and he was admitted to Long Reach Hospital, the usual disinfection procedures being carried out. 10 SECTION VIII VENEREAL DISEASE Venereal Disease is not compulsorily notifiable to Medical Officers of Health but efforts are made both by the Boarding Medical Officers and the Port Health Inspectors to bring to the notice of seamen using the port the facilities available for free treatment and the importance of obtaining skilled treatment as early as possible. Should there be a known case, it is usually possible to arrange for the patient concerned to be taken at once to the nearest clinic of the Seamen's Hospital or other hospital in the vicinity of the ship.

"Orcades" At midday on the 8th May, information was received from the Medical Superintendent of the P. & 0. Orient Line, that a Utility Steward who had been admitted from s.s. "ORCADES" to the Seamen's Hospital at Greenwich on the 4th May had been diagnosed as suffering from Typhoid Fever. He was admitted to the ship's hospital on the 30th April, having been ill for some days previously, but was free to go about the ship. It was not known at this time what his exact employment had been but he may have been handling food, so it was decided to take precautions accordingly. It was arranged that the Company doctor, with the assistance of the Port Health Inspector in Tilbury Dock, should take specimens from all the catering staff to ascertain whether any of them were capable of passing on the infection. As it was possible that passengers who were disembarked on the 4th May and members of the crew who had gone on leave might be incubating the disease, it was decided to notify Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which the passengers and crew members had gone. There were some 1247 passengers and 419 crew members. It was later established that this man had been employed only in the Goanese mess. It seems unlikely, therefore, that he would have been able to infect any of the passengers or crew other than the Goanese. Further, as the date of onset was about the 24th April and he joined the crew in Bombay on the 17th April, it is very unlikely that he contracted the disease on the ship though he himself was infectious. In all the circumstances, in order to protect the public the measures taken were indicated by the facts as known on 8th May. Typhoid Fever — m.v. "Arlanza" On the 10th June 1964 a request was received from the Shipping Federation for advice as to the disposal of a Senior Engineer from the m.v. "ARLANZA" lying at that time in the Royal Victoria Dock. It appeared that this man had some slight abdominal complaint but had a history of contact with a confirmed case of typhoid fever in Aberdeen. Because of this history this man was admitted to hospital for observation. He developed typhoid fever two days later and this was confirmed by telephone from the hospital on the evening of the 15th June. Routine disinfection and surveillance procedures were started on the "ARLANZA" on the 16th June but that evening another telephone message was received from the Enteric Reference Laboratory at Colindale stating that it could not be guaranteed that the patient had not been excreting the typhoid bacillus during his incubation period. This altered the situation very considerably and it was decided to screen as many as possible of his contacts on the "ARLANZA" and to carry out a crash disinfection programme on the 17th June. The problem of time was acute as the ship was due to sail on the 18th June at 1300 hours. As a result of considerable effort on the part of the Port Health Inspectors in the docks all the toilet and wash-hand basin facilities, all the galleys and all the dining accommodation on the ship were disinfected. In addition, specimens for bacteriological examination were taken from as many of the contacts as possible. In the cases where this was not possible contacts going home were notified to their local Medical Officer of Health. Typhoid Fever — ss "City of Hull" On the 10th July, 1964 it was reported that an Engineer from the s.s. "CITY OF HULL" who had been admitted to the Seamen's Hospital at Greenwich had been confirmed as a case of Typhoid Fever. The patient, had not been home since December, 1963. The ship left Capetown on June 12th having spent some weeks coasting in the Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, Laurenco Marques, and Beira areas. Before leaving Capetown on the homeward journey the ship took on a quantity of fresh milk which was distributed to individual members of the crew. Investigation of this milk was not possible and no evidence incriminating it was discovered. From the 12th to 24th June the ship was on voyage to Las Palmas, and during this time, probably on the 20th June, the patient fell ill with headaches and a raised temperature. He did not go ashore at Las Palmas. The ship docked on the 29th June in London but the patient was not admitted to the Seamen's Hospital until 5th July. The "CITY OF HULL" and three other ships to which some members of the crew of that ship had been transferred, had sailed from London before the diagnosis of Typhoid Fever was confirmed or this department knew the case. The Captains of the ships and the Port Health Authorities of the Ports to which they were bound, namely Hamburg, Montreal, Aden and Las Palmas, were informed so that appropriate action could be taken. All the passengers who disembarked and those members of the crew who had gone on leave needed to be put under surveillance, and this presented a problem because of the postal dispute. An attempt was made to phone the Medical Officers of Health responsible for the districts concerned, but by this time on Friday evening many of these Health Departments had closed and the information could not be passed until the Monday morning. 12 The Seamen's Hospital had seen three other members of the crew in the casualty department on varying dates between the docking of the ship and the confirmation of Typhoid Fever in the patient. Their symptoms were not. particularly suggestive of Typhoid Fever but as they had been left in a Seamen's Hostel in the East India Dock Road while under treatment it was thought advisable to admit them to the Hospital for observation. This was carried out with the invaluable assistance of the Medical Officer of Health for Poplar. Although the patient did not go ashore in London he had several visitors on board, mainly representatives of engineering firms. These men were at some risk as they may well have been given food or drink by the patient. It must be remembered that there was a strong possibility that he was suffering from the disease for nineteen days before the diagnosis was confirmed. It was therefore felt that these men must be found and warned and placed under surveillance. This proved to be a difficult task but eventually all those whom the patient could remember as having visited him were traced and put under health control. Paratyphoid — "Anco Spur" On the 6th October, 1964, a letter was received from the Medical Officer of Health, Port of Liverpool, that the Swedish Tanker "ANCO SPUR" had arrived there on Friday the 2nd October and the Agents for the ship in Liverpool had informed him that Messboy aged 17 had been hospitalised in Rotterdam on the 28th September and was thought to be suffering from Typhus Fever. Further, a Chief Steward aged 35 who had gone to Hamburg on private business had been hospitalised there with the same diagnosis. The letter further stated that the necessary measures to cleanse the ship had been taken and that the Chief Steward had been discharged from hospital on Friday 2nd October and rejoined the vessel while the messboy had been diagnosed and confirmed as suffering from Paratyphoid fever. This ship arrived in the Port of London on the 29th September, 1964 from Philadelphia, Lisbon and Rotterdam. She gave a completely clean bill of health and therefore was not boarded by the Boarding Medical Officer at Gravesend. It then became a matter of following up all the contacts, i.e. the people who boarded the ship in the London River, in order that they might be placed under surveillance for paratyphoid fever. There was also the matter of the exact diagnosis for the Chief Steward. It was thought best to put everyone who had boarded the ship under surveillance and therefore the Inward Sea River and Docking Pilots, the Customs, Immigration and River Pilots, the Cargo Watcher, the Boatmen and Lightermen and the various representatives of firms were all notified to their local Medical Officer of Health. m.v. "Roxburgh Castle" — Contaminated Water Supply. The m.v. "Roxburgh Castle" arrived at Tilbury Dock on Saturday evening 4th April, 1964. The Port Health Inspector boarded her on Monday morning 6th April and carried out the initial inspection and investigation. The ship had sailed from Capetown on 13th March, and called at Las Palmas on 25th March for bunkers and water, and at this point the domestic water tanks were nearly empty. After Las Palmas the ship was at Hamburg from 31st March to 1st April, and at Antwerp for one day, 3rd April, before coming to London. No water was taken on board between Las Palmas and London. From normal enquiry on board it became apparent that at least ten different members of the crew had suffered from sickness and diarrhoea from 2nd April onwards, but as most ratings had paid off and left the ship, full particulars were not obtainable. The general hygenic standard of the catering department was satisfactory, and the only common item of food and drink that could be incriminated, bearing in mind the generalised outbreak of minor sickness in officers and crew, appeared to be the drinking water. Arrangements were made with St. Clement's Hospital Pathological Laboratory to test samples of drinking water from the Galley, Midship Pantry, P.O's Messroom, and the Sailors' Messroom. The following day provisional results obtained by telephone indicated faecal contamination in all the samples. The vessel's water supply was obviously unfit. m.v. "Roxburgh Castle" was due to sail at 8 p.m. on the 7th April and as a matter of urgency the Port Health Inspector met on board the owners Marine Superintendent, and the ship's Master, Chief Engineer and Chief Officer. The chlorination of all the ship's domestic water, which was contained in three tanks and amounted to 158 tons, was supervised. This included water taken at Tilbury the day before, when the tanks had been topped up. The ship sailed for Capetown on 7th April and an undertaking was given that the ship's tanks would be cleaned out, examined internally for leakage, repaired if necessary and replenished at that port. The vessel had on board an adequate supply of Sodium Hypochlorite to be used after filling tanks. The cause of the contamination will possibly never be discovered but there are three possibilities (a) Inadequate precautions taken with equipment hoses etc. when water was taken at Las Palmas; on 25th March. (b) Apart from a 12 ton tank in between deck, the othertwo tanks in the ship holding 73 tons each are in the double bottom. It is considered that this form of storage for drinking water is always hazardous, ships do touch bottom from time to time. This vessel, however, was dry-docked and surveyed in February this year when the D.B. water tanks were examined and cleaned, and the Master has no reason to think there was any seepage into these tanks from outside. 13 (c) Normal maintenance work on the fresh water circulating pump carried out by engine room staff could lead to contamination but enquiry on board produced no evidence to support this. Subsequently the owners received a letter from the ship at Dakar to the effect that there had been no further cases of sickness and that fresh water taken on there had been chlorinated to the required standard. DENTON HOSPITAL Although Denton Hospital has been taken over by the South East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board under the National Health Services Act, the Port Health Authority continues to exercise, through the Senior and Assistant Port Medical Officers, the medical supervision of cases admitted to the hospital. The nursing and administrative control lies with the Dartford Hospital Management Committee. Consultant advice on difficult cases is available through the Physician—Superintendent of Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford, who whenever necessary transfers cases there for special investigation and treatment. The number of cases admitted to Denton Hospital in 1964 was as follows:— Chickenpox 8 Chickenpox contact 1 Dermatitis 3 Influenza 2 Malaria 1 Measles 11 Measles contact 4 Miscellaneous 2 Pneumonia 1 Rubella 1 Tonsillitis 5 Follicular Tonsillitis 1 40 SECTION X OBSERVATIONS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF MALARIA ON SHIPS Nine cases of Malaria (all seamen) were reported on ships during the year under review. This compares with six cases in 1963. Six of the seamen were well on arrival, and the other three were admitted to hospital on arrival in London. A notice giving advice on the Chief Precautions and Treatment of Malaria is issued by the Ministry of Transport and should be on board every British ship. SECTION XI MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST SHIPS INFECTED OR SUSPECTED OF PLAGUE No ships infected with or suspected of plague arrived during the year. SECTION XII MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS IN SHIPS FROM FOREIGN PORTS The statutory authority for this important function is contained in Regulations 19— 21 of The Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1952-1963 (implementing the provisions of Article 52 of the International Sanitary Regulations, 1951), The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 and the Prevention of Damage by Pests (Application to Shipping) Order, 1951—56. To undertake this responsibility, the Port Health Authority employs a competent and experienced staff of sixteen Rodent Inspectors, who exercise control measures on ships and over the shore premises within the Docks. The three aspects of control are, to prevent the importation of rodents by sea or land transport, to prevent infestations within the Docks, and to curtail any movement of rodents within the Port, so it is imperative that all the staff work as a team throughout. In all circumstances, the operations are carried through under the general supervision of the Port Health Inspectors. 14 To a great extent the International Sanitary Regulations assist in the prevention of rodents being imported by sea, for all foreign-going ships are obliged to have a Deratting or Deratting Exemption Certificate according to the conditions on board at the time of irspection by the Port Health Authority issuing the Certificate. The certificate must be on the prescribed form and is valid for six months. A thorough inspection must be made of all compartments of the ship when empty to provide the comprehensive, information to be recorded on the Certificate. Similar action is taken in respect of coasting ships, an appropiate certificate is issued and remains valid for four months. Apart from these requirements all ships are inspected on arrival at the terminal berth for evidence of rodents and the procuring of specimens for bacteriological examination, particularly from those ships arriving from ports that are likely to be ur are infected with plague. It is customary to attend all ships in order of priority as soon as practicable after arrival at the berth and, if possible, before any disturbance aboard so as to gain the advantage of more conclusive rodent indications . The incidence of rodents being imported into the Docks by land transport has gradually diminished and this can be attributed partly to the more hygienic construction of installations and routine attention given to them by health authorities. However, it has been noted that transportation of agricultural produce tends to attract mice, which are more elusive than rats and create circumstances which call for specific modes of control. Cargoes of seeds from the Continent have been particularly vulnerable to mice infestations, while grains, animal feed and organic material are more attractive to rats. As with the land transports, so with the water-borne traffic it has been noted that where the standard of sanitation has been raised, the incidence of infestations has been proportionately reduced, and the transport enterprises have been encouraged accordingly. Rodenticides. The range of chemical rodenticides used during the year included, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, methyl bromide, blood anti-coagulant, sodium-fluoroacetate and sodium-fluoroacetimide. Not one of these alone is a panacea for all circumstances and conditions. It has been customary to use methyl bromide or sulphur dioxide on lighters, sodium-fluoroacetate and sodium-fluoroacetimide aboard ships and the anti-coagulants in shore premises as a general principle. Hydrogen cyanide has slowly lost popularity as a fumigant on vessels in favour of methyl bromide, particularly when the compartments have contained infested cargo, since the latter has more penetrating qualities and acts as an insecticide as well as rodenticide. Because of relative operational simplicity, sulphur dioxide has found popularity with lighters in need of deratting. The pungent nature of the gas reduces risks of fatality among the semi-skilled labour force employed, and it is quite effective as a rodenticide when properly applied. The overall results for the year are quite satisfactory and the rodents actually recovered inc lude:- Rats Mice. Ships 812 Ships 151 Shore 1,693 Shore 1,714 2,505 1,865 This represents a numerical drop compared with last year, when 3,131 rats and 2,601 mice were destroyed, although there has been no relaxation of effort. The reduction may well be due to the consistent drive to eliminate rodent harbourages ashore and afloat. The number of dead rodents actually recovered is but one facet of the work. When the fecundity of these pests is considered, the full effect of continuous control must include the arrest of the enormous breeding potential. The decline of infestation aboard sea-going ships was almost dramatic, while operations on the harbour lighters proved to be of immense value in preventing the spread of infestations around the Port, In providing a reliable check on the health of the rats in the Port and,of course, in reducing the number resident to breed and cause economic losses to food and property. Of the 64 rats submitted for bacteriological examination to the Public Health Laboratory Service, none were found to be affected with P.pestis. Continuous Control of Rats on Sea-going Ships. In recent years, some ship owners, in an endeavour to reduce the rat population aboard their vessels, have had them fitted with permanent boxes, containing warfarin, a blood anti-coagulant bait. As these baits must remain rat attractive for fairly long periods a fungicide is added to the prepared baits to prevent deterioration. 15 This system of control relies on adequate coverage of all hold spaces, forecastle head spaces and tonnage hatches. Each baiting box contains about 1 lb of bait and the boxes are fitted on both sides of the vessel in each compartment. The total number of boxes installed in a ship varies with the size and the number of decks. Surveys of vessels subject to this form of control indicate an average number of baiting points of seventy-five per ship. After the initial installation, it is necessary for the baiting boxes to be regularly serviced This is normally carried out by the servicing pest control contractor. Apart from replenishing all boxes it the end of each voyage, many require replacement or repair, having been damaged during cargo operations. The shipowners engaged in trading with West African ports have always had a difficult problem with rat re-infestations during each voyage. Hydrogen cyanide fumigation and later treatments with sodium-fluoroacetate ("1080") were frequently necessary .The Warfarin control was first used in February, 1962 and since then it has been extended to other ships. The rat populations have been reduced considerably as a result. When vessels, fitted with these boxes, have been discharged a few dead rats have been recovered frequently from the cargo. During this year, no considerable rat infestation has been discovered in a "controlled ship." Whilst other factors have contributed to the reduction of rat infestations on merchant vessels, such as the modern rat proof construction of ships and more attention given to rodent control measures at international seaports, the following figures indicate the progress made since continuous control was introduced three years ago.

B.C. - THE ABOVE DIAGRAM REPRESENTS THEIR ADOPTION OF WARFARIN CONTROL. Effective Rodent Control with Sodium-Fluoroacetate After much has been spoken, speculated upon and written about the toxity of this rodenticide and about the stringent precautions that are imperative while dispensing it and in operational techniques, it is stimulating to record the benefits derived from its careful application in this Port. 16 For fifteen years it has been used effectively to destroy rat infestations which would, undoubtedly, have survived without this lethal bait. Extermination is relatively quick compared with other popular rodenticides and this factor is of importance in a major and busy seaport such as London. During this period many specific incidents have convincingly demonstrated the value of this chemical in the 'armoury' of the rodent control organisation. Mention is made here about one of the Dock Groups which has always been and is yet particularly vulnerable to rat infestations. It is a terminal for ships covering most international trade routes, receives many rat-attractive cargoes and provides a considerable amount of rat harbourage. Persistent effort has continued over the years to reduce and maintain the rat population to a minimum and success has been achieved in good measure by using this poison, with out which the Staff would have laboured in frustration. RODENT CONTROL ON LIGHTERS Rodent control on lighters always has a special significance insofar as the results indicate fairly accurately the conditions and trends in the whole Port. It is a feature which has the unstinted attention of the rodent control staff stationed on the River, one of whom spends the greater part of his time with a launch on this work. Because these craft ply between points and ships scattered throughout the Port and carry a variety of rodent attractive cargoes imported from all parts of the world, rodent control on them provides an excellent opportunity of detecting rodent diseases before they can become firmly-established at the terminal berths or in the warehouses. It is gratifying that the staff have the full support of all sections of the Industry both in the commercial field and in the lighter repair yards, where most of the deratting work is carried out by fumigation under their supervision. Prevention is better than cure and much stress has been laid on the technique of rodent-proofing of the craft compartments to eliminate favourable conditions for hiding, breeding and communications. It has been unfortunate that because of absence of staff through illness there has been a reduction in the number of inspections made during the year. However, the overall conclusions are encouraging, as shown in the following tables. One noteworthy point which has arisen is the need to have and retain a sufficient and enthusiastic rodent control staff if the spectacular results achieved in this Port are to be maintained. Whereas rats were considered an inevitable nuisance in lighters only ten years ago, their presence is now promptly reported and measures taken for their extermination.

Two such Orders have been made. The first in 1936, covering the public and private layings bordering the part of the foreshore of the Estuary of the River Thames between Canvey Island and Shoeburyness; and the second, in 1957, covering the foreshore or waters bordering that part of the Estuary of the River Thames or any tributary thereof, between Garrison Point, Sheerness, and Warden Point in the Isle of Sheppey. Export of Portuguese Oysters from River Roach The adverse effects of the severe winter of 1962/63 were mentioned in the Annual Report for 1963. As a result of that winter, the severity of which was felt over most of Europe, the oyster layings in the River Roach and adjacent creeks were at a stand-still for many months. Indeed the trade in Native oysters has still not recovered. The trade in Portuguese oysters has however received an unexpected boost by the establishment of an import — re-export trade. The River Roach and Barling Hall Creek have proved to be suitable areas for "fattening" Portuguese oysters. Thus, during the spring of 1964 some 500,000 Portuguese oysters (Ostrea Angulata) were imported for fattening from Coimbra area of Portugal, were laid in suitable beds in the area and were eventually re-exported "ready for the table" to France. This has entailed co-operation between the Oyster Company concerned, the Public Health Laboratory Service, the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (Marine Laboratories), and the Port Health Authority. Although the River Roach is not a "prescribed area" and there has never been any restrictions on its oyster beds there is always the possibility of faecal contamination. It therefore was decided as a safety measure that all oysters should be passed through a Cleansing Station. The procedure enabled the Medical Officer of Health to sign a Certificate of Purity which was asked for by the French Authorities. The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food Marine Laboratories provided technical advice, and some existing tanks were adapted as a Cleansing Station. Samples of oysters which had been cleansed in this station were drawn at regular intervals from August onwards and examined at the Public Health Laboratory at Chelmsford. 19 From October there was a weekly despatch of oysters to Paris, some 30,000 at a time, all duly graded as to size and suitably packed in baskets of 100 oysters each. Each batch was accompanied by a Certificate of Purity from the Port of London Health Authority in whose very extended district this Export Drive has taken place.

Organisation of the work:— Aliens and Commonwealth Immigrants are medically examined, at the request of an Immigration Officer of the Home Office, on arrival in the Port by the Medical Inspector, who is either the Boarding Medical Officer or a part-time Medical Inspector called in to deal with a particular ship. A 24 hour a day boarding service is maintained at Gravesend.

SCORPION INFESTED TIMBER CARGO The advice of this Authority's Officers was sought on the possible danger to cargo handlers arising from a type of insect found among the timber cargo on board a ship in the West India Dock. On examination of a specimen it was found to be an Indian scorpion of approximately 3" in length. A thorough search of the vessel was made and the cargo handlers were questioned about the possible extent of the infestation. Several scorpions of varying size and colour had been seen and killed and it was decided that spraying with a heavy Pyretheum based insecticide should be undertaken whilst the discharge of the cargo took place. This resulted in further scorpions being killed. A live specimen was sent to the London Zoo who stated that it was a fine specimen of Indian female scorpion of which they had only one other specimen. 20 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) (Vessels) Regulations, 1958. It has been another year of cautious optimism and experience has confirmed the awareness of the Shipping Industry of the requirements of the Regulations and of the determination of the Authority to enforce them. More Inspectors have studied and qualified as Smoke Inspectors. On many occasions during the year, the combination of tact and advice has minimised smoke emissions and sustained good relations between all concerned. Unlike permanent shore establishment shipping is more subject to changes in circumstances, particularly coal burning ships, for example the suitability of available fuel, competency of stokers, and the range of efficiency of installations. Furthermore, the demands for steam are more intermittent and variable aboard ship in port, particularly some harbour craft giving rise to periods, of incomplete combustion and inevitable emission of dark smoke. All ships, of course, must prepare for sea and incomplete combustion cannot be avoided while the installation is cold. This has been considered and is a 'defence' in the Regulations, a fact not always realised by members of the general public who witness the pall of smoke from the ship. Nevertheless, the duration and density of such emissions are not disregarded by the Inspectors, who are capable of assessing the technical aspects of the operation and preventing exploitation of the 'defence'. Making a smoke observation can be a depressing occupation, particularly when the emission appears to be offensive. Time drags to the extent that the observer's mind tends to exaggerate the circumstances. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to keep a true sense of judgment throughout and to secure a witness whenever possible. It is quite possible for a ship to emit a very large volume of smoke slightly less than the Dark Smoke shade Ringelmann 2 and in some weather conditions, to considerably pollute the atmosphere without infringement of the Regulations. However admissible this may be, it is unfortunate that some seafarers believe that there is no restriction on the amount of smoke that may be emitted, providing it is not Dark Smoke. This being the case, it emphasises the need for tactful approach to ensure that such emissions are kept to a practical minimum. Generally, the internal combustion engine continues to displace the steam engine and oilfired boiler and the pattern of atmospheric pollution is changing from one of grit and soot to one of offensive sulphur gases. Such complaints have been received from the tenants of dwellings on the fringe of the Docks and have been investigated, but no positive solution has been found. The policy of boarding offending vessels promptly to curtail smoke emissions has been continued and the efforts have nearly always met with success. It would appear that most of these spasmodic incidents arise from foreign vessels where the engineers have not become fully acquainted with the Regulations and from British vessels where there is sometimes a suggestion of apathy in the stokenold. Enquiries indicate that in these days of full employment there seems to be some difficulty in recruiting the desired type of stokers ready to accept the traditional discipline of theBritish seafarer. Officially recorded action taken during the year included:- Prosecution 1 (Successful) Statutory Notices served 6 Informal Notices and Warnings 22 PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936, PART X-CANAL BOATS Four inspections of canal boats were made during the year. No canal boats were found to have any defects. LOADING AND TRANSPORT OF REFUSE BY LIGHTERS Bye-Laws for the Prevention of Nuisance arising from Refuse in or upon any Ship, Boat or Vessel. The Port Health Inspectors stationed on the River Districts keep watch upon the loading conditions at the refuse wharves and also ensure that the refuse lighters are properly covered during their passage down river. During the year one infringement of the Bye-Laws was reported and successful legal proceedings taken. 21 HOUSEBOATS AT BENFLEET The Essex County Council Act, 1952 provides that the mooring of any houseboats within the County shall not be lawful without the consent of the Council of the district in which the houseboat is situated and that the Council may require the owner or occupier to remove or to demolish any houseboat not authorised by them. However, the Port Health Authority are still held responsible under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 for the sanitary supervision of houseboats coming within the jurisdiction of the Port Health Authority, although, according to the Essex County Council Act 1952, the local Council in Essex are responsible for licensing houseboats and establishing conditions under which such licenses will be granted. The responsibility of the Port Health Authority in relation to the sanitary supervision of houseboats has been acknowledged by Section 212 of the Essex County Council Act, 1952 which provides inter alia that no license shall be given to moor a houseboat within the Port of London without the previous consent of the Corporation of London as the Port Health Authority of the Port of London. During the year, the Benfleet Urban District Council granted temporary licenses to twenty-one houseboats, no objections to these applications being raised by the Port Health Authority. It is anticipated that this number will gradually diminish for various reasons and it has been noted that less of the craft appear to be used for permanent habitation. The new factor for consideration, apart from the sanitary conditions of the houseboats, is the enviromental conditions of the permanent moorings which could be prejudicial to health. These will be considered with other aspects in full co-operation with the Local Council. DANGEROUS DRUGS During the year thirty-one certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations,1953, Regulation 13 (2) of which is as follows:— (a) The master of a foreign ship which is in a port in Great Britain shall be authorised to procure such quantity of drugs and preparations as may be certified by the medical officer of health of the port health authority within whose jurisdiction the ship is or, in his absence, by the assistant medical officer of health, to be necessary for the equipment of the ship until it reaches its home port. (b) A person who supplies a drug or preparation in accordance with a certificate given under this paragraph shall retain the certificate and mark it with the date on which the drug or preparation was supplied and keep it on his premises so as to be at all times available for inspection. PIGEON CONTROL While the feral pigeon problem remains there must be vigilance to counter incursions of flocks from outside roosting sites. Such roosting centres as exist in the Docks are given regular attention with a view to the elimination of nesting and the destruction of eggs. The usual places frequented by the flocks include the granaries, although any centres where food is available receive a quota. Controlling procedure continues on the same pattern. Sporadic operations are carried out by an expert private Contractor employed by the Port of London Authority while some regular control measures are adopted by tenants within the Docks, using their own employees to trap birds and destroy eggs. Operational techniques include the use of narcotic bait and the subsequent destruction of the birds recovered while under the influence of the narcotic. These operations are, of course, conducted when the Docks are not working normally in the early morning when pigeons frequent the Docks to feed. There has been less evidence of fouling of premises and of damage done by pigeons. No major complaint has been received, and minor complaints have been negligible. Number of birds trapped 712 Number of eggs destroyed 496 Number of birds narcoticised 8,717 22 m.l. "Alfred Robertson" m.l. "Victor Allcard" THE OLD AND THE NEW m.l. "Alfred Robertson" Since being commissioned in 1937 this motor launch has efficiently rendered almost continuous service to the Authority in every aspect of duty afloat within its limits of power and capacity. Built to the traditional, robust design of the age, with the rather sophisticated form of a tugboat, the launch was able to withstand the rigorous demands of the busy Tideway traffic and especially the congested pockets of lighters. The high standard of maintenance carried out by the crews and the various modifications introduced during its life and contributed to make the launch a worthy representative of the Port Health Authority. Although not endowed with a spectacular speed, there was no lack of stamina and reliability. The 'Alfred Robertson' is due to go out of service in the New Year. m.l. "Victor Allcard" Built as its successor the m.l. 'Victor Allcard' has modern features which eclipse those of the 'Alfred Robertson' in relation to profile, efficiency and amenities for the crew. Generally, the construction details and performance are commensurate with the higher standards required of an efficient port health service in a major seaport. Although equally robust in construction and with several details in excess of Lloyd's Specification requirements, the attractive form of the hull and superstructure have not been impaired. Adequate flare at the bows has been provided to cater for turbulent waters of the Estuary and the need for an increase of speed has been met within reasonable limits. The overall control of the launch's movements by the Navigator, the R/T communications with harbour services and seagoing vessels and the improved Ambulance Room facilities contribute to the features in advance of the predecessor. May she be equally successful in serving the Authority. VISITORS AND STUDENTS There has been a continued decline in the number of individual overseas students sponsored by Fellowships for study of port health organisation and practices which may indicate that the supply of trained personnel to the developing countries has reached the objective for the time being. Many of those trained here will now occupy senior appointments and be able to instruct junior colleagues and new entrants in the home ports. Nevertheless, those who received instruction included public health. inspectors from: ADEN, CEYLON, DAR-ES-SALAAM, HONG-KONG, IRAN, ISRAEL, LIBERIA, MALAYA, NIGERIA, SPAIN, THAILAND and TANGANYIKA. There is a growing demand for instruction to student public health inspectors from local authorities and twenty-nine students have received tuition during the year. As distinct from this individual tuition, there are many who come as organised groups from centres of health education to study the particular aspects of the work of the Port Health Authority. Such centres include London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, University of London Institute of Education Educational Interchange Council (Incorporated) National Society for Clean Air Tottenham Technical College. To accommodate the purpose of these visits fully throws an occasional heavy strain upon the resources of the field staff, but this is cheerfully borne for the sake of public health and the extension of good relations between the Authority and those represented. FOOD HYGIENE (DOCKS CARRIERS, etc.) REGULATIONS, 1960 Since the commencement of these Regulations in November, 1960 several noteworthy improvements have been made in the handling of imported meats, equipment and vehicles. Personnel and premises also have been subject to an informal code of practice which resulted from a series cf meetings held with the various interested parties. During the year the Inspectors in the docks endeavoured to maintain a good standard of practice, and where necessary brought pressure to bear to maintain the gains achieved and to resist any reversion to old customs and habits. In general, verbal warnings were sufficient, indicating the goodwill and co-operation existing between responsible officials and managers and the Port Health Inspectors. On one occasion, however, it was necessary to take proceedings against a road haulage company for using a dirty vehicle, the resultant prosecution being successful. 24 In consultation with the Port Health staff one of the major meat importing companies has improved its meat cutting store in the Victoria Dock. Two band saws, which were unsuitably situated, have been removed and one of them re-instated with drainage in a newly constructed cutting room. A new hot water supply has been installed for washing down the premises and equipment with suitable provision f<x the personnel to wash their hands. All these provisions were in full operation by the latter part of the year. To implement and maintain the requirements of these Regulations in the Docks has demanded tenacity tempered with patience during a period when the Port has been passing through various stages of modification and sensitive industrial relations. However, improvements in facilities for dock workers who handle unprotected foods, particularly meat, may result from a different approach to the method of employing dock labour. It may be possible then for employers to provide changing rooms, washing facilities, toilets and protective clothing in purpose designed buildings which will do much to improve working conditions and hy giene in general.

In consequence of this, the number of bacteriological samples drawn and sent to the Public Health Laboratory has risen sharply as the trade in boneless meats and pets meat continues to flourish. Tables are appended giving details of the work done during this period. A limiting factor to the range of expansion is the size of the examination room at the cold store and unless more accommodation is provided by adding another similar room, the present staff of inspectors will continue to be hampered in their work by congestion. 31 Apart from this difficulty, it is gratifying to report progress and achievement in port health control of meats imported for human consumption and those intended for the pet food trades. Physical examination Table 1 shows the amount of meat examined for disease (other than bacteriological examination). Although comparisons from year to year are not always the best guide to the amount of useful work actually done, it can be seen that in 1963 the numbers of items examined totalled 6,776, during 1964 this figure rose to 14,808. Table la shows the same type of examination, but in this case, the number of consignments examined, the occasions when disease was found in. them and the percentage of disease in the consignment. This method of examination which involves unpacking, thawing, examining, hardening and repacking is probably the only method available to a Port Health Authority to check the reliability of the Official Certificate system. The Port of London Health Authority is unique in carrying out such surveys over a wide range of meats. Where disease is found direct contact is made with the country of origin, through the officials appointed by the meat exporting countries, and action to prevent further failures usually follows quickly. Bacteriological Control Meat samples drawn for bacteriological examination are itemised in Table 2. The number drawn during 1964 totalled 7,256 which compares with 3,782 in 1963. It will be seen from this table that 37.2% of all horsemeat samples drawn produced salmonellae. Samples of Kangaroo meat were worse, 52% samples being positive. Pets Meat Trade More than half of the bacteriological samples relate to meat intended for the pets food trade and are part of the control measures and administrative work carried out by the dock staff to give effect to existing legislation, particularly the Meat (Staining and Sterilization) Regulations, 1960. This trade continues to present administrative problems to this Authority. The following figures give some idea of the numbers relevant to the scope of imports. Horsemeat control Number of packages released ex ship 207,799 Number of packages sent to Dock Store 61,690 269,489 Average number per week 5,182 Kangaroo Meat Number of packages detained 9,847 Inedible Meats (other than Horse and Kangaroo) Number of packages released for sterilization 269,173 547,509 A disproportionate amount of time is spent by the inspectors and clerical staff dealing with this trade, since the detention examination and release of which involves a considerable amount of documentation. It would seem therefore appropriate to consider the usefulness of present regulations and the effectiveness of the control measures imposed. Accordingly the pasteurisation of pets meat by irradiation in the dock, prior to its release into the channels of distribution, is a possibility increasingly attractive to the pets meat trade and to Local Authorities. Conclusions The great variety of meats now being imported into this country from many diverse exporting countries demands a constant vigilance on the part of the dock staff. New types of ready-to-cook prepared raw meats and the great increase in boneless manufacturing meats require changing techniques in examination and control. It is hoped that the new legislation at present in draft form will permit adequate safeguards to be exercised by port health authorities and in no way curtail what is at present found effective in the existing regulations. 32 TABLE 1 1964 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FOR DISEASE Commodity Argentine Uruguay New Zealand Australia U.S.A.

They regulate the contents, qualities and labelling specifically for the various types of bread and flour. The Regulations deem it an offence to import flour which does not contain chalk and nutrients in proportions set out in Schedule 1 of the Regulations and an offence to import flour containing a bleaching agent or improving agent other than those approved by the Regulations. Specific conditions are provided for added colouring matter. It is normal practice where "formal" samples are taken from an imported food to place the consignment under detention at the Docks, but this procedure has proved impracticable with large consignments of flour owing to the length of time required by the Public Analyst for his examination. The detention at the Docks would inevitably cause serious congestion and impede the flow of imports into the discharging berths. For this reason, the consignments have been allowed forward to the terminal warehouse under formal and agreed detention and there to remain pending the sample examination and report of the Public Analyst. This adopted procedure has proved acceptable to those concerned. During the year, an aggregate of 10,051 tons of flour were imported into the Docks and, from this, 14 samples were taken for examination by the Public Analyst, of which 8 proved satisfactory and 6 were unsatisfactory. None were considered as seriously offending the provisions of the Regulations but were found deficient in one or other constituent, such as chalk or nicotinic acid. The Importers were notified and warned that the flour should be treated to obviate the deficiencies before distribution for human consumption. THE COLOURING MATTER IN FOOD REGULATIONS, 1957 During the year 1964, due to the immigrant population from Asia and the West Indies as well as the growing popularity of oriental food in the home and restaurants, a marked increase has been noted in the importation of such commodities as chilli and turmeric powders, together with curry powder, which contains varying proportions of these two powders mixed with cayenne, ginger and other spices. Upon analysis, some of the powders, primarily of East African origin, were found to contain prohibited colouring dyes, including Sudan Red, Brilliant Croceine and Metanil Yellow. In one instance, the crude dye had been found in the form of small lumps amongst the powder. During the normal analysis, any adulteration is also reported by the Public Analyst and in some cases this was discovered to constitute large proportions rising to as much as 30% by the admixture of ground rice, com and pea meal. Whilst such adulteration does not strictly contravene the provisions of the Imported Food Regulations, and has occurred without the powder containing a prohibited dye, the normal practice of disclosing the Public Analyst's findings to the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which the goods were destined has continued. The merchant has also been advised of his responsibility under the Food and Drugs Act should he wish to offer the commodity for retail sale. The Public Analyst has stated that in order to find a recorded example of this type of adulteration it has been necessary to refer back to a publication "Food, its Adulterations and the methods for their Detection", by Hassal, published in 1876. It is gratifying to report that demands for re-export of seven consignments, totalling 17½ tons which contained prohibited colouring dyes, has led to the almost complete cessation of this practice. It is also interesting to note that, as a result of consistent vigilance of the Inspectors concerned, one of the leading importers in this country has now required from the exporters a certificate of analyst prior to the shipment of these powders. FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS ACT, 1926 FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS REGULATIONS, 1960 Seven samples of Feeding Stuffs were submitted to the Agricultural Analyst. No sample of Fertiliser was sent In each case the sample was found to be within the limits of variation permissible under the Regulations. 36 APPENDIX I MEDICAL INSPECTION — From 1st January to 31st December, 1964 GRAVESEND Jan.
