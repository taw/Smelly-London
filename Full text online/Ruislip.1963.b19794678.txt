To the Chairman and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, During 1963 further progress was made towards the integration of the Urban District into the proposed new London Borough of Hillingdon. It is pleasing to be able to report that in this, one of the last years of the District as a separate entity, there was no untoward event, locally, in the public health field. This state of affairs was not universal - there were epidemics of infectious disease in various parts of the world, and with the great increase in modern travel, these inevitably had their local repercussions, involving investigation and surveillance of contacts. Typhoid fever was one condition which caused some anxiety, but fortunately no case occurred in the district among any of the exposed contacts. The occurrence of epidemics, even though not happening locally, serves to remind us of the continuing need for vigilance. It also helps to emphasize the need, not only for the usual measures of hygiene, but also for the protection of as many individuals as possible by means of modern inoculation techniques. The place of vaccination in protecting travellers and service personnel against smallpox has been mentioned in previous reports and its importance - particularly in a district so close to a major airport - cannot be overstressed. Protection against other infections continues to be necessary continually. Although, once again, there was no case of diphtheria in the district, this happy state of affairs will only persist so long as parents continue to present their children for the full course of immunisation. As in the previous year, no case of poliomyelitis occurred - this is in marked contrast to the position existing a few years ago, when there was great fear of this disease, before the introduction of either the injected or the oral vaccine. Success in the control of certain of the infectious diseases brings inevitably its own drawbacks - parents are more difficult to convince of the necessity of having their infants protected against dangers of which they have no experience, and which they no longer see around them. The more successfully infectious diseases are controlled, the harder becomes the effort involved in controlling them. As expected, there was the biennial wave of measles cases - 1291 compared with 46 in the previous year - with one death in a complicated case. Research is at present in progress with a view to finding a suitable viccine which will prevent this disease, and which possibly will be able to be incorporated with the other injection materials at present in use. Only time will tell whether or not this idea will be successful. If it is, then it will be a further great step forward in infectious disease control. The other local statistics show no changes of significance. There were fewer infant deaths, but the total numbers being dealt with are not large enough to expect this to be more than a welcome annual variation. The causes of these deaths are set out individually in the report, and it will be seen that they are all due to conditions about which we know very little. The only hope here lies in intensive research and meticulous ante-natal care, which of course is being applied now to the best of our ability. Cancer, heart and arterial diseases remain the principal causes of death. Last year, attention was drawn to the number of women - 13 - who died from lung cancer. This year the number has fallen to 10, but this is still double that of two years ago, and is disquieting. Nothing has happened to change the view that heavy cigarette smoking is a major contributing cause of lung cancer, and the total number of cases - 51 against 45 a year ago - speaks for itself. This is a disease in which prevention is firmly the responsibility of the individual (or parent); the local authority can do very little. The usual day to day work of the Public Health Inspectors continued as usual, and the statistics are detailed in the report of Mr. Jenkins, the Chief Public Health Inspector. Constant and careful inspection is the foundation of environmental hygiene, and this district has been particularly well served in this respect; Mr. Jenkins and all his colleagues in the department deserve great commendation for their continuing efforts. Public Health work depends to a considerable extent also on the co-operation of general practitioners and hospitals; in this district this has been available at all material times in full. Finally, no department can operate successfully without the full support of its controlling committee and especially its chairman. This has been forthcoming in full measure, thereby making the work of the department a pleasure. I am, Your obedient Servant, O. C. DOBSON, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS TOTAL AREA OF DISTRICT 6,583 acres.
