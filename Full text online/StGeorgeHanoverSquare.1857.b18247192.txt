HAN 7 QUARTERLY SUMMARY SICKNESS AND MORTALITY Saint George, Hanokr Square, AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOR TEE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR 1857. Presented, to the Vestry Feb. 2, 1858, and ordered to be Printed. LONDON. TO . THE Destry of St. George, Hanoder Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, In compliance with the resolution passed by the Vestry, December 1st, 1857, " That the Medical Officers of Health, in addition to their Monthly Report, be desired to present (quarterly) a summary," we have the honour to submit the following account of the sickness and mortality of the parish, and of the matters on which we have each presented Reports to the Sanitary Committees respectively, during the last quarter of 1857. Such a compendium will necessarily refer to some circumstances which occurred in the previous quarter, for the first Report was dated so early as October 5th; but the annexed Table of Mortality, applying to the whole parish, records only those fatal cases that occurred within the thirteen weeks ending December 26th, 1857. The Table shews that, during thirteen weeks ending December 26th, 1857, 442 deaths occurred in the parish, including the deaths of 62 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, and of 17 inmates of the workhouse at Little Chelsea. 4 This is a high rate of mortality, inasmuch as it gives about four deaths per week in excess of the mortality of the last ten years; and it is in particular high by comparison with the corresponding weeks of 1856. During those weeks of 1856, the entire number of deaths in the parish, exclusive of those in the workhouse at Little Chelsea and in St. George's Hospital, was 298 ; in 1857, it was 353. The deaths of children under five years, were 105 in the thirteen weeks of 1856, and 143 in 1857. The births, during the corresponding weeks, were 512 in 1856, and 521 in 1857. This excess of mortality we believe to be chiefly due to the three most prevalent zymotic diseases, scarlet fever, measles, and typhus, or common fever; the deaths from which were 17 in the last quarter of 1856, and 48 in the corresponding quarter of 1857. Acute diseases of the lungs were also very fatal. The deaths from consumption are 46; from other lung disorders, 86; from premature birth, 11; from old age, 16. Diarrhoea, which, with the allied diseases, dysentery and cholera, destroyed 64 lives during the preceding quarter, was this quarter fatal in four cases only, and these were in the Belgrave Sub-district. The greater liability of this Subdistrict to these maladies cannot now be owing to any difference in the water used; moreover, out of the 64 deaths in the summer quarter, 56 were of infants under one year, many of them at the breast: neither can it be owing to greater poverty, or overcrowding; for no part of the Outwards is so densely peopled as some parts of the In-wards. It is probably owing to the lower level, and may cease when the Thames is embanked and purified, and some of its inlets filled up. 5 With regard to our own proceedings, and the means by which we hope to lessen the amount of mortality, we beg to mention these three lines of operation. In the first place, by encouraging the supply of drier, lighter, and better ventilated homes for the poor, we diminish the amount of scrofula, consumption, rickets, and similar maladies, which consist in a degenerate and ill-nurtured state of constitution, and which not only themselves destroy life largely, but also render their victims unable to cope with any other disorder that may befall them. In the second place, by getting rid of the poisonous gases arising from cesspools and drains, by banishing all filth and offensive refuse, and by freely admitting pure air, we remove the sources from which some zymotic diseases are believed to arise absolutely, and from which they all certainly gain malignity and the power of spreading. In the third place, by promoting the healthiness and comfort of the poor man's home, we counteract, in some measure, various temptations to intemperance, and other breaches of morality, and the tendency to the diseases which are liable to follow. Besides, we notice any circumstances whatever which bear upon the health of the people, so that they may be enquired into, even if they cannot be immediately remedied. On the 29th of October we attended a Special Petty Sessions at the Board Room, Mount Street, held for the purpose of hearing applications for licences for slaughterhouses, when five out of twenty-nine applications from the Out-wards, and four out of seventeen from the In-wards were rejected. The removal of the slaughter-house from under the densely-peopled houses in Grosvenor Market, is a matter for congratulation; although, neither in this case, nor in 6 any other which was rejected in consequence of the slaughterhouse being situated under ground, was there any complaint of want of cleanliness or care. We have each of us, during this quarter, presented a Report to the Local Authority, respecting the mischiefs arising from some of the rag and bottle, or marine storedealers. Our independent testimony is corroborated by that of Mr. Grant, the Inspector. We shew that there are about forty premises, in various parts of the parish, in which bones, fat, rags, and other offensive refuse is collected. These materials are often accumulated within inhabited rooms, or in the basement of densely-peopled houses. Moreover, there is as little precaution or method used in the removal, as there is in the collection and stowage of these things. Putrid fat and bones are carted away openly in the dog-days, and taint the air to considerable distances. Lastly, these shops (even with the most honest intentions on the part of the occupiers) unavoidably offer temptations to fraud, by the facilities which they give for disposing of stolen goods. High prices are obtrusively offered for almost anything which can be pilfered from private houses. This is a matter of which we are forced to take notice, inasmuch as it is a direct obstacle to the proper water-supply of poor houses, under present circumstances. There are many cases in which we cannot compel a landlord to replace pipes and taps, which are stolen again and again. We drew up, with the sanction of the Committee of Works, a set of recommendations to the persons engaged in this trade, as to the most safe and cleanly manner of keeping and of removing refuse matters, which, with an extract from the Nuisances' Removal Act, was circulated by the Inspector. We would call attention to the circumstance, that whilst an 7 excess of caution is used with regard to slaughter-houses, these equally dangerous premises are left without effective regulation; and we believe that a legislative measure for this purpose would be a benefit to the public, and be felt as a great protection by the respectable persons who carry on the business of marine store-dealers. In the' Hanover and May Fair Sub-districts, during the last thirteen weeks of 1857, the total number of deaths registered was 153, including 22 in the Mount-street workhouse. Of these, five were cases of measles, 14 of scarlet fever, and three of typhus or continued fever. In the corresponding portion of 1856, the total number of deaths registered was 138, including 29 in the workhouse. Of the 138, two were cases of scarlet fever, one of measles, and one of typhus. Throughout this quarter of 1857, there was abundance of illness, and especially of the zymotic, or epidemic kind. 1126 cases of illness were relieved by the Parochial Medical Officers, and by the Medical Officers of the Dispensary in Mount-street; whereas, in the corresponding part of 1856, the total number of cases so relieved was 787. The 1126 cases include 55 cases of measles, 21 of scarlet fever, and 78 of various kinds of common, or continued fever. Hooping cough, catarrh, and influenza were prevalent, and cases of chicken pox and mumps were scattered here and there. During this period, the number of deaths in Belgravia amounted to 270, of which 62 were those of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. Zymotic disease killed 43 persons, of whom 14 died from scarlatina, eight from typhus fever, and six from croup. The deaths in this part of the parish, during the last 8 thirteen weeks of 1856, were 231, including 56 of nonparishioners. Scarlatina and diphtherite destroyed 7, measles 4, and typhus 6 persons. No. 5, Hanover Place.—In consequence of general dirtiness of these premises, a notice under the " Nuisances' Removal Act, 1855," was served on the occupier on the 23rd June, and a second on the 16th July, 1857 ; but these were disregarded, and on the 1st October the premises were in the following condition. Outside dirty; windows broken; passages, staircases, and yard most filthy; water supply cut off, consequently, no water to closet; roof leaky, insomuch that water penetrates through the floor of the third story into the rooms beneath; the upper floor and the kitchen inhabited by decent people; two other rooms tenanted by 10 most dirty and squalid persons, destitute of furniture; these people pay no rent, inasmuch as the occupier has absconded; the front door is open all night, and the house a nuisance to the neighbourhood in more ways than one. It was certified to the Sanitary Committee that this house was " so filthy and dilapidated as to be a nuisance and dangerous to health," and it was advised that proceedings should be taken under the 13th section of the " Nuisances' Removal Act, 1855," in the hope that the owner or occupier might be prohibited from using the house for a human habitation until it should have been rendered fit for that purpose. The peculiarity in the case was, that the occupier had absconded in arrears of rent, and that the owner was willing to put the premises into proper repair if he could obtain possession of them. The Committee directed application to be made to the Magistrate at Marlborough Street, who, after hearing the case, decided that the best way of removing the nuisance 9 would be to put the rightful landlord in possession. This was accomplished on the 13th November, when the police ejected all the occupants, and gave up possession to the owner, who has since put the house into thorough repair.* No. 10, Reeves' Mews, a house of eight rooms, containing 10 persons in three families, had been deprived of water supply for more than two years; consequently there was no water to the closet; and it is difficult to conceive of any mode of creating a more dangerous nuisance than this. Notices had been served in April, but disregarded in consequence of some conflict of interests in the house. By the exertions of the Inspector, the work was accomplished in November. No. 30a, Grosvenor Mews, is the designation of one front of an immense and densely occupied pile of buildings, extending back to North Bruton Mews, where it has a frontage known as No. 18. It contains from 60 to 80 inhabitants, stowed away in various courts and recesses, very ill supplied with light and air. It was always unhealthy and offensive, and continued so in spite of the fact, that the owner had been compelled by a notice, dated 30th May, 1857, to cleanse the premises and make improvement in the water closets. At last, however, fresh investigations discovered a large open cesspool in a cellar underneath the room of a sick woman. This cesspool had been opened and left so for months. A notice was issued, which was immediately complied with, requiring the removal of the cesspool, and substitution of pipe drainage. * N.B.—The Times, 9th January, 1858, reports a case of expulsion of tenants from a house, on the ground of unwholesoineness, by the order of Mr. D'Eyncourt. a 2 10 Carrington Street, a cul de sac at the back of Shepherd's Market, contains 12 houses and one small cottage. About six of the houses are of the better class, and contain each from 12 to 20 inhabitants; the remainder from 20 to 40. There has been of late much sickness in the street, and five deaths in three months, four of young persons. No. 4 had long been very offensive in the basement, although clean in every other respect; the owner has been induced to examine the drains, and, as they were defective, to substitute new pipes; the offensive saturated earth has been mixed with quick lime, and the house is now sweet. No. 10 required some improvement to the water supply, which is not yet completed. In the yard of this house was a collection of filthy bedding, which was caused to be removed as a nuisance by Notice issued for that purpose. It belonged to a lodger who had left; and it well shewed one mode in which the germs of fever might lurk and be propagated. No. 12 required some little improvement, which the proprietor readily effected. Nos. 6 and 8 are still dirty, overcrowded, and ill-smelling, and appear likely to remain so unless the owners are compelled to do something. No. 8 contains about 40 inhabitants. Brick Street.—The houses on the north side of this street, between Engine Street and Carrington Place, have been several times visited by fever, not attributable to the habits or circumstances of the highly respectable persons who live in them. On these grounds, as well as to remedy the dampness of the neighbourhood, the Sanitary Committee have recommended an examination of the drainage. In one of the kitchens, which is also used as a sleeping apartment, the water stands regularly at a level of about a foot under the 11 floor, and there is a small well, out of which the water is baled every day. Hertford Place.—Still more necessary is an examination of the drainage of this place. It consists of 10 houses, containing at the least 200 inhabitants, often many more. The proprietor, at the request of Dr. Druitt, caused some improvements to be made in the summer of 1856 ; but yet at present the drainage is complicated and defective; and in certain states of the wind, the houses from No. 2 to 8 inclusive, are filled with gusts of foul air from the sewers. A thorough drainage of Brick Street and Hertford Place would be a great benefit to the whole neighbourhood. 2, Bruton Place, accommodates 15 families of 64 persons in the house and in a range of buildings round the yard. As there was much sickness in it, with no palpable cause, great pains were taken to inspect every part of it. The following particulars may be stated. Upper rooms offensive from filthy slops thrown into the gutter inside the parapet; the rain water pipes, contaminated by these matters, often have currents of foul air passing up them ; some of the families live in wooden lofts erected round the yard over the washhouses and dust bin ; water supply in uncovered butt; only two water closets for 64 people, one of them without water ; a gully inside the house admits a most offensive current of air from the sewer. The highly respectable proprietor has caused all these things to be rectified. 10, Grosvenor Mews.—A house containing 12 families and 52 persons. There is a rag and bottle dealer on the ground floor. The drainage, according to medical testimony, is defective, and requires examination. Blomfield Place.—In No. 27 of this large lodging house, there was 1st, a child ill with typhus; 2nd, another seized 12 with measles, and dying in a few hours; 3rd, another seized with scarlet fever; 4th, the first child, who was recovering from the typhus, was seized with the scarlet fever and died. Every effort was made in vain to induce the parents to remove the children, which step would probably have saved two lives. Mr. Newson, the proprietor, has erected an additional cistern, and does all he can for the benefit of the 28 poor families of 150 people who live here. 3, Shepherd's Market.—A house which furnished one case of cholera in the summer, and two or three of fever since. An offensive water closet and untrapped drains have been remedied. 24, Brooks' Mews; 10, Chapel Street East; 292, Oxford Street; 1 and 2, Woodstock Street; 5, Blenheim Street; 2, John Street, Grosvenor Mews ; 8, Robert Street; 6 ib.; I, Mount Place ; 6, Bruton Street; 1, Little Bruton Street; II, Brook Street; 7, Mount Row; 23, Down Street; and 16, Brick Street, are houses where various nuisances have been investigated and removed. 293 and 294, Oxford Street.—The latter house rendered very unhealthy by foul smells, which caused fever and sore throat. After exhausting every source of nuisance above ground, the Inspector suggested that the sewers should be examined, when a large, neglected, choked up sewer was found passing immediately under the houses in question. This sewer has been cleansed and filled up by the authorities of St. Marylebone; yet, unhappily, the nuisance in the house is not abated. The occupier however has been instructed as to the best course to pursue, and the case is now in his own hands. The Pump at the corner of Oxford Street and Park Street, which draws its water from a very deep and ancient 13 well, has unfortunately been contaminated with sewage. It belongs to St. Marylebone, the authorities of which parish have, on complaint being made, removed the pump handle. Drainage of Stables.—In treating of this matter it must be remembered that there is a large proportion of the poorer classes who live over stables, and consequently would require proper water supply and drainage, even if no means were requisite for draining away the urine of the horses. But until lately there were many stables in which there was absolutely no drainage of any sort; so that slops were emptied daily in the mews to the great nuisance of the neighbourhood. In others there were cesspools under the stalls to receive the horses' urine; some of which cesspools were provided with water-tight bottoms, and were emptied once a week, creating a great nuisance; others were constructed so as to allow the urine to soak into the earth, and thus to diminish the wholesomeness of the soil. The advantages of proper drainage are easily shewn. The consumption of straw is greatly diminished, including the labour and cartage in bringing it, and in taking it away in the shape of manure. The stables are very much sweeter and wholesomer for the horses, and for the poor people who live over them; and the grooms say (it is to be hoped truly) that they have less necessity for drinking in the morning than they had when they used to enter the stables in their former close and offensive state. So palpable are these advantages, that the proprietors of many stables have willingly incurred the heavy expense of new drainage. In the great square block bounded by Brick Street and Piccadilly, N. and S., and by Park Lane and Down Street, E. and W., there are the great livery stables of Mason, 14 Clough, Atwood, and Cutler, and others, which together accommodate 300 or 400 horses, now virtually all drained. In Carrington Mews, Nos. 3, 4, 11, 38, 41, 45, and 49a, have been drained; in Curzon Street, No. 15 ; in George Street, Grosvenor Square, Mr. Ponsford's ; Union Yard, New Bond Street; 3, Farm Street Mews; 56, New Bond Street; 5a, Tenterden Street; 60, Lee's Mews; 13, North Row; 6, Market Street Mews ; 16, Lee's Mews ; 1, Dean's Yard; King's Mews, South Street; No. 4, ib.; Hawkins's Stables, ib.; 34 and 42, Adam's Mews; 22, Brick Street; Red Lion Yard, Union Street; 4a, Little Grosvenor Street, (no longer used as an habitation); White Horse Yard Stables ; 22 and 22b, Davies' Mews. Other stables remain till it shall be convenient to the proprietors to execute the work. It may be mentioned, that on November 6th, several members of the Sanitary Committee accompanied one of the Medical Officers of Health on a visit of inspection to several parts of theln-wards. They visited Mr. Scarlett's and Mr. Allen's slaughter houses ; Providence Court, Brown Street, Tom's Court, Thomas Street, Robert Street, Grosvenor Market, South Molton Lane, and Hanover Place. A memorandum of matters noticed was drawn up by one of the Committee and deposited with the Clerk. Such a visit repeated at intervals will be of immense service. The tabular returns of Sanitary Inspections by the Inspector, and of existing Nuisances, with recommendations thereon by Dr. Aldis, related to 66 different places in t he Belgrave Sub-district that required sanitary improvement, including the premises of 21 marine-store dealers, in nearly all of which cases notices have been served, and the nuisances abated, or are in progress of amendment. 15 Weekly returns have also been presented, recording 5335 new cases of disease, which came under treatment at the following Institutions:—1. Workhouse, Little Chelsea; 2. Out-patient paupers; 3. St. George's hospital; 4. Royal Pimlico Dispensary; 5. St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary. The returns for two weeks ending Saturday, the 19th and 26th days of September, shewed 140 cases of diarrhoea. Another for the weeks ending the 3rd and 10th days of October, exhibited 79 cases of diarrhoea, and consequently a diminution of 61 cases in comparison with the previous one, the greatest number having happened during the week ending August 29th, when they amounted to 326. It was reported to the Committee that the decrease of this complaint was to be looked upon with satisfaction, more especially as a serious outbreak of cholera had taken place in this country at Abbey Row, West Ham; there was also reason for congratulation that no exertions had been spared in abolishing nuisances from Belgravia wherever they could be detected; although its future invasion might not be prevented, nevertheless, the Committee would be better prepared than before sanitary measures were commenced. Moreover, it should be remembered, that diarrhoea had been much more prevalent last autumn than the previous one, and that 37 cases had proved fatal during the thirteen weeks ending Saturday, 26th September, 1857, the mortality having, with the exception of one man, aged 75, confined itself to children. In consequence of the fatal outbreak of cholera at West Ham, it was recommended, that the utmost vigilance be exercised with regard to the state of the sewers and gully-holes, some of which were very offensive. That the 16 houses be carefully watched, the removal of house-refuse be strictly enjoined, and notices drawn up cautioning persons to attend to the ordinary conditions of health, be printed and circulated. A house to house visitation was commenced wherever diarrhoea had ended fatally. Attention was directed to the occurrence of scarlatina and severe quinsy, more particularly in Caroline-street, where, in one house, three cases had already proved fatal, and an infant soon afterwards died from that complaint. In another house, in the same street, four children were found suffering from the same disease, and the premises were in such a bad condition as to need thorough repair. Certain slaughter-houses were also reported to be quite unfit for the intended purpose. Three deaths from typhus fever having occurred at one house in Upper Belgrave Terrace, the premises were visited, and although apparently clean and healthy, yet it was found that the children lived in the back kitchen, the window of which was generally open, and close to a common privy, very offensive, with a dust bin uncovered, full of dust and decomposing vegetable matter. These evils were soon remedied. It is gratifying to mention that a Meeting took place among the licensed Butchers, on Wednesday, October 21st, and a Committee was appointed to adopt the best means of cleaning away the refuse and garbage of slaughtering between 10 p. m. and 8 a.m. The water in the Plunge Bath at Lower Belgrave Place, during the summer, continued remarkably clear, until nearly the middle of October, when it became turbid and of a dark brown colour, though when poured into a tumbler it appeared to be sufficiently bright for drinking purposes, the larger mass having produced a dark shade. 17 This discolouration was attributable to the fall of rain which, on Thursday, October 22nd, amounted to the enormous quantity of 2*57 inches. An analysis of the water taken from the above place before bathing commenced on Tuesday, October 27, 1857, gave the following results:— Organic inpurity, 2 '96, Inorganic impurity, 15 '20. Another specimen, taken from the main in Chapel-street, Belgrave-square, on the same day, produced— Organic impurity, 2*24, Inorganic impurity, 16*16 ; so, notwithstanding its bad appearance, the quality of the water was better, in reference to the quantity of organic matter, than that in the former analysis of October 1856. Complaints were often made that stables in Bclgravia, perhaps containing several stud of horses, have been without any drainage or ventilation. One stable containing 27, another 54, and a third 90 horses, all belonging to the same Company, were in the condition just described. The ostlers on opening them in the morning have suffered so much from nausea and headache, owing to the foul state of the atmosphere contained within, as to have no appetite for breakfast. The litter also, in such cases, becomes so saturated with filth from neglect of drainage, that when accumulated in the dung pits, it occasions a great nuisance in the neighbourhood. The walls also are damp, rendering these places very unwholesome for habitation. The dung removed from the Omnibus yards was intolerably offensive from being kept too long, and when disturbed, the smell became unbearable to passers by, or persons residing in the vicinity. Notices, in these and other instances of a like nature, have been served to remedy the 18 evil, and large sums of money have been expended in improving the drainage and ventilation. Indeed, it is exceedingly important, that these places be carefully inspected from time to time, in consequence of the large number of them contained in Beljgravia. A short time ago six children were found sleeping in a part of the loft of one of them, at No. 6, Ebury Mews. This chamber measured 11 feet 6 inches in length, 8 feet in width, and 7 feet 6 inches in height; and a wide bedstead, with a large cupboard, diminished the cubic capacity. It has neither window, skylight, nor fire place in it, and there was merely a door opening into the next room, so that the air, especially at this season of the year, must become stagnant and very offensive. There was a trap door in the floor of the next room admitting foul air from the stables, and allowing the children to tumble through, occasionally. This aperture was approached by a ladder, extending to a water closet, out of repair, with the pan broken. A notice was served, and the requisite alterations have been completed. The yard opposite to the above premises was in a very offensive state from neglect of sweeping it, from the pavement being out of repair, and obstructed gullies. The water also had become very foul, through uncovered butts, and the dust occasioned by making chaff from hay in the same loft where they were fixed. The tenant complained of frequent illness since she resided there, assigning the bad state of the water as a cause of her indisposition. Covers have been placed upon the water butts, and the one used to contain water for drinking purposes has been removed to another place. The gullies are now in working order, and the yard kept properly cleansed. At No. 5, in the same Mews, a cabman lay ill with fever, 19 and a stench existed in the coach house, although the stable was clean and well painted, in fact, it appeared the cleanest of all; but on further examination, a cesspool, 15 feet deep, was discovered, the contents of which readily percolated into the earth, because it was constructed without proper brickwork at the bottom. The landlord was quite unacquainted with the fact, and at once agreed to have it rectified upon receiving intimation of the nuisance. A great advantage would have accrued to the property near these stables, if the sewer, already existing in Ebury Mews, had been prolonged to Elizabeth Street, and drains made into it instead of their passing under the houses in front; a plan which might now be carried out, if each landlord could be induced to pay his share towards this object. The Rev. J. H. Hamilton has frequently complained of the present arrangement, and would gladly contribute his proportion for making this alteration. Indeed, the system of carrying drainage under houses at all, is much to be deprecated, but at present it is, generally, unavoidable. The Belgrave Dock was nearly empty, with stinking mud exposed to the action of the air, and the water in a very foul condition. The Executors of the late Mr. William Cubitt were written to upon the subject, who immediately carried out such suggestions as were calculated to obviate the ill effects that might arise. The next and last point is one of considerable importance as regards the health of a portion of the Belgrave Sub-district, and we earnestly desire to obtain a remedy for it,—we refer to the open state of part of the King's Scholars' Pond Sewer, which has been often before reported upon, and public attention drawn to it in the Times of July 13,1857. We are told to wait until the main drainage scheme is brought into 20 operation before this monstrous nuisance can be removed, and that covering it with brickwork would be too expensive for a limited period. Now, five, or ten years may elapse before the main drainage plan is in working order, then what is to be done meanwhile ? Is South Belgravia to be polluted by noxious gases, and no efforts made to counteract their noxious influence? Dr. Aldis has proposed weather boarding, with girders to form a roof, which would last ten years, as a substitute for brickwork, and has been assured by Messrs. Cutiiell and Keeble, that about 600 feet of the sewer, enough to protect the neighbourhood, could be covered over in this way, at a cost of only £250, and that the Executors of the late Mr. William Cubitt are willing to subscribe £100 towards so desirable an object.
