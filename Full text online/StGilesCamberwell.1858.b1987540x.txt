LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE YESTRY, BY S. BILLING & SON, BBRM0ND8EY STREET. 1859. 1 SURVEYOR'S REPORT, For the Year ending March 25th, 1859. Gentlemen, In presenting for your consideration my Report on the works executed under your authority during the past year, I beg leave to preface the same by some remarks on those works, proposed to be constructed by the Metropolitan Board in the Southern division of the Metropolis, by carrying out the SOUTHERN MAIN DRAINAGE. The settlement of the long contested controversy relative Main Drainto the Drainage of the Metropolis was, as you are aware, Metropolis, brought about by the peculiarly offensive condition of the River Thames during the heats of last summer, and we have lately had evidence, again shewing itself in the condition of the water of the Canal running through part of this parish, to induce the fear that a similar result may be anticipated in the ensuing season. Such an occurrence, however much to be regretted, had the effect of bringing to a conclusion the vexed question of the Metropolitan Main Drainage, and produced a scheme 4 which all interested therein confidently hope will accomplish satisfactorily the great end for which it has been designed. A short account of that portion of the scheme which refers to the Southern Metropolis, will I trust not be considered an unprofitable occupation of the time of the Vestry. southern The design of the Southern Main Drainage consists of Main sewer two systems of Arterial Sewers, viz. High and Low Levels, The former being intended to intercept at the foot of the high ground all the drainage above it, and to convey the same by gravitation to its ultimate outlet at Crossness Point in the Erith Marshes. Effra Relief In connexion with this work there is also the Effra Relief Main Sewer ... Line, intended to intercept the more elevated, and equally impure drainage arising in the locality of Norwood, which is at present the principal feeder of the Dulwich open Sewers, some of which open Sewers affect in their course the salubrity of one of the most rural and valuable portions of this parish. Low Level The Low Level Sewer is designed with'the view of afford- Main Sewer . ing to the lower portions of the Southern Metropolis a permanent outfall, by means of pumping, and thereby ridding it of the constantly recurring results produced by a pent up and tide locked system of sewerage. Having glanced at the foregoing propositions, I will now describe somewhat more fully (as far this parish is concerned) the intended course of these main lines, as well as the results to our own local sewerage, which they are calculated to produce. 5 The Main High Level Sewer has its commencement at or Southern High Level near the Plough Inn," Clapham common, thence along High Main Sewer street, Clapham, Stockwell private road, Love lane, Park and Robert streets, to Loughboro' road and Holland road, where it enters this parish, crosses the Market-garden ground to the Lilford Arms Tavern at Lilford road, thence in a direct line to Cold Harbour lane, which it crosses at Denmark street, then crosses Denmark hill opposite to De Crespigny park road, and along this road to and crosses Grove lane and also Camberwell Grove at the Mews at the lower end of Park buildings, crosses through private grounds at the rear of the Peckham road, intersects the road leading from opposite the Vestry hall to Bates' brickfield about a chain north of the turn in this road, and continues through the meadow on the premises of R. A. Gray, Esq., and onward in a straight line through the Freehold Land Society's estate to Lyndhurst road, thence along the Hanover or Image road, and Hanover street to Rye lane, which it crosses by the Hanover Arms Public House, and passes on to the Braid road crossing it about 100 feet south of the Harders road, it then continues to the Gordon road, near to Hill house in a direct line to the upper end of St. Mary's road, passes along the road at the north side of St. Mary's church, and crosses the Cemetery road at the angle formed by the boundaries of the parishes of Camberwell and Deptford, thence in a similar direction to the Dennett road in the last named parish, near which it meets with the Effra Relief Line, (to be presently described) from which point these two Sewers run eastward parallel to each other, south of the High Kent road until they pass under the Brighton Railway, from whence they take 6 the line of the Turnpike road as far as Deptford Broadway and diverge therefrom into and along Church street, passing under Deptford Creek at the Dock by the Flour Mills, at this point the Low Level will be pumped up into the High Level Sewer, and thence by one large Sewer will ultimately continue through Greenwich and Woolwich to Erith Marshes. I would here beg to remark that the construction of even this portion of the great work will tend to more important results than at first sight may be apparent—for by the interception of the drainage from the high grounds the flooding of the lower levels will be prevented, even if it were not intended eventually to construct similar Sewers for these lower portions which at present are always deluged on the occasions of heavy rains such as have occurred through the recent storms, and when as an additional misfortune (from the accident of the high tides at the time of the storms, and consequent closed up condition of the tidal flaps next the Biver Thames) the basements and cellars throughout the lower area of the district were submerged, and considerable damage resulted to house property. Eor it is indisputable that these floodings occasion incalculable injury to house property, and cause depreciation of the value of the holdings and consequent loss in the parochial rating. Effra Relief The Effra Relief Line which forms an important part of southern the work I have just described, is intended to commence Main age, near to Croxted lane, at the parish boundary, passing along the narrow path leading from the bridge (crossing the Effra Sewer there) to Back lane, continuing along the same past 7 the west side of the College, and thence through the village as far as the Burial ground, where it diverges by the farrier's shop into the open fields, passing under the high ground here (where the work will be tunnelled for about a quarter of a mile in length) in the direction of Lordship lane, which it enters near to Blackwater cottage, continues along Lordship lane as far as the private road north of the Brick field, and thcnce across the fields to near the end of Harris' road at Goose green, opposite Whiteman's lodge, continues along Goose green by the King's Arms Public House, and across Peckham rye in a straight line to Nunhead lane, passes along Nunhead lane and the southern side of Nun green, and along the partially formed road and public footpath down to the Cemetery road, near which it crosses the boundary of the parishes of Camberwell and Deptford, to the point of meeting with the Main High Level Sewer before described. The construction of the Effra Belief Line, whilst it intercepts from many of the open Sewers of Dulwich the present offensive sewerage before referred to, and frees the neighbourhood of Brixton and Vauxball, and also that portion of the River Thames from the pollution derived from this locality, will at the same time open up a source of permanent sewerage for the entire Dulwich district, which in the course of a few years it must necessarily demand, through the appropriation of the College property to more extended usefulness for building purposes. Another important advantage which may be anticipated from the execution of this portion of the main work, is the 8 getting rid of the sewage matter from the open ditches and streams which bound the rural area of this parish, for it is a fact which cannot be concealed that wherever house property rears its head in suburban districts, which are unprovided with efficient sewerage, there the adjacent streams and water courses become polluted, by the almost necessary recourse which has to be resorted to in order to rid the immediate vicinity of the property so erected of its drainage. To prevent the further pollution of these rural water courses, has been the constant care of this Vestry during the term of its conservancy of the sewerage of the parish, but from the reasons above stated, and from the errors of past and exploded systems of drainage of former years, the remedy for the evil could not be carried out without incurring (and that with the expectation of an early and improved system now about to be realized) an eventually useless expenditure. A contract for the before mentioned works has been advertised by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and there is reason to hope that in a short time their actual progress will be visible in this parish. Peckbam Rye , Drainage, Pond, &c. Whilst referring to this portion of the Main Drainage Works, I think it necessary for a moment to direct your attention to the locality of Peckham Eye. As you are aware, through the operations of the Vestry, the whole of the drainage from Forest Hill is now brought down in arched sewers to a point on the Eye Common by Ear by Cottages, from thence its natural course is through the 9 Common into the Eye Pond, thence down to Cow lane by an arched sewer; and along Cow lane it is again open until it reaches near to Clayton road. Although I have, both on the Eye near the head of the Cricket Ground and also near the Heaton Arms Public House, introduced means of diverting the sewage (except in times of storms) into covered channels, nevertheless when floods occur there necessarily is brought down into these open ditches (and eventually into the pond) much that is offensive and prejudicial to the healthy reputation of this favorite spot; with this view therefore I am induced (but not without some misgiving that I may possibly be misunderstood) to recommend that the favorable opportunity which will be afforded of effecting vast improvements on the Eye, by filling up and abolishing these open ditches, and possibly the pond itself, with the spoil from the works now about to commence, should not be lost sight of. The suggestion to deprive Peckham Eye of its pond may probably be considered an attempt at an act of spoliation not justified by necessity, but an examination into the whole subject, to which I have given much consideration would, I believe, fully authorize the proposition, and the execution of which would eventually tend to the improvement of this locality. Believing that this matter must at no distant date become a subject of further deliberation, I will only anticipate a future report to enable me further to lay my views before you. As regards the Low Level Sewer, the detail plans not yet Low Level main server having been made public by the Metropolitan Board of Works, I will not now further refer to it than to say, that this is the most important work of all for this locality, as it 10 will provide a constant outlet for our local sewerage, and a deep and effectual means of draining all streets and premises within the lower portions of the parish, it is to be hoped that no unnecessary delay will take place in putting this work into the hands of the contractors, inasmuch that it will take considerable time in its execution, and any euspension of this work only further protracts the period when this parish shall receive its full and most needed share of benefit from the Main Drainage Works. The Main High Level Sewers, as I before remarked, will tend much to lessen the evils of our depressed area by cutting off the flood waters, but the Low Level Sewer with its pumping appliances, can alone provide for the effectual sewerage of such a locality. Temporary In reference to the time which must necessarily elapse Pumping station at ere the completion of these vast works, I would here ven- Earl ssewer Rotberhithe. ture to remark, that I still think if my suggestion of "a pumping station to be constructed next the Eiver Thames," at the Earl Sewer outlet (see my Eeport, dated Sept. 16th, 1857) were even now to be adopted, (that viewed only as a temporary measure), the expense would be amply justified by the result, in preventing such floodings as have occurred so lately as during the last four weeks, and to which I referred in an early part of this report. LOCAL NEW SEWEES. Local New From the foregoing statement relative to the Main Sewers Drainage Works, it will be seen that but little local sewerage can at present be undertaken, and even of such 11 as I have had the privilege of bringing before the Vestry, it was considered advisable to defer the execution of a portion until the great scheme was more fully developed,— consequent upon these reasons, is the somewhat small amount of new work executed during the past twelve months, in comparison with those of the preceding two years. Nevertheless, several works important in a sanitary point of view, have been executed in addition to those of a similar character referred to in former Reports, and which make a total length of about miles of new sewers constructed since the formation of this Vestry, and which in most cases have taken the place of foul and offensive open ditches so long the bane of the parish, but now altogether abolished. The new works executed during the past year are as follow:— 73 Feet 3 . 0 Barrel Sewer. 1680 Feet 12" Pipe ,, 668 Feet 9" ,, ,, No. 55 New Gullies constructed and trapped. ,, 58 Old ,, trapped, &c. The entire length of Sewers under the control of the Local 1 Sewers Vestry is as follows: Brick Sewers 14 Miles. Pipe ,, 5¾ ,, Open ,, 8½ ,, Total 28¼ Miles. The cleansing, repairing and general supervision of which Sewers have been executed in the usual manner, and I am enabled to report generally upon their effective working condition and state of repair. 12 cleansing. The Kent Road Sewer from St. Thomas-a-Watering Bridge Kent Road to the Canal, has been cleared out as far as was necessary Sewer, to relieve the house and gully drains connected with it from choking up by the amount of heavy deposit within this sewer, and although its level lies so much below its present outlet, it will now I believe sufficiently drain its immediate locality without the necessity of incurring farther expense, until the Main Low Level Sewer which most probably will be constructed near to it, shall release it altogether from its present water-logged condition. open Earl In concluding this portion of my Report, may I beg Sewer, rear of Albany again to draw your attention to the open Earl Sewer running at the rear of the Albany Road; the frequent complaints made on this subject renders it, I venture to submit, an imperative duty on this Vestry again to urge on the Metropolitan Board of "Works the necessity of at once arching it over; the adjoining parish of Newington, which in addition to the house property situate on its banks, has another and more powerful argument to impress on the Central Board, viz.—that its poor located within the "Workhouse, which is situate but a short distance from this sewer, are constantly breathing its impure exhalations. A union of the two Vestries with such unanswerable evidence to urge in furtherance of this work, supported by a joint deputation of tbe representatives of the two parishes would, I think, cause the Board to respond favorably to the appeal. HOUSE DRAINAGE. House The following will shew the number of applications for Drainage. House Drainage which have been received, and as far as 13 possible complied with, and the property connected with the sewers; in the other cases where sewers have not yet been constructed, cesspool receivers have been resorted to as a temporary measure until sewerage is provided; in all these cases the House Drainage has been so designed, that whilst iu many instances the means cannot be obtained of perfect drainage, it nevertheless is so constructed as to avoid the frequent nuisances observable in old property, arising from an unauthorized and badly arranged system of laying in the house drains and cesspools. These matters as also the inquiry into and remedying nuisances, constantly brought under the notice of the Medical Officer and myself, are sedulously watched by your Inspectors of Nuisances, to whose zeal and assiduity in the performance of their duties I beg here to accord my approbation. HOUSE DEAINAGE, Lady-Bay, 1858, to Lady-Day, 1859. No of Applications. No of Houses permanently drained. No. of Houses temporarily drained. 146 325 97 422 14 IMPROVEMENTS. CAMBERWELL GREEN. GreenenveI1 The completion of the enclosing and planting this Green, and the free and frequent use now made of it by the public, need I think only but to be referred to, to prove how well justified was the Yestry in its determination to secure this open space for the recreation of the inhabitants of this locality. HIGHWAYS. Repairs of The necessary repairs and cleansing of the Roads and Highways. Thoroughfares under the charge of the Vestry (upwards of 32 miles in extent) have been carried on in the same manner as reported last year, and I believe I can with confidence refer to their general condition, that they will bear a satisfactory comparison with the Roads of adjoining parishes. As opportunity has occurred, and the means at my disposal could command, I have without increasing the expense usually appropriated to such purposes continued to carry out such improvements in their formation and drainage which ultimately tend to lessen the wear of the material and also the labour and expense of cleansing and carting away the slop. Gas and But there is one great impediment with which the water Trenches. veyor of Roads has to contend, and which seriously prevents a perfect condition of the Highways under his charge, 1 15 mean the incessant openings for gas and water trenches— the daily occurrence of these Highway disturbances, causes much anxiety and annoyance to those in charge of the repairs of the public Thoroughfares, and although I by no means state this as a reproach upon the Gas and Water Companies (at least as far as this parish is concerned) from whom I receive every courtesy and attention to my directions, I think it only due to myself to refer to the fact, to satisfy you that it is wholly impossible in a District, where gas and water are now generally becoming requisites of daily life, but that these changes in our social system should produce their corresponding annoyances and injury to the Roads, which without such interruptions would not so often exhibit the broken up appearance they frequently present, and which without having the cause explained, might be attributed to the negligence of the officers who have them in charge. NEW ROADS. The only additional Road brought under the charge of New Roads, and Street. the Vestry during the past year is Nelson street, Wyndham road, a length of 600 feet. This Road which up to the time of the Vestry taking it in hand, was a foul swamp raised high above the level of the ground floors of the houses by the refuse therefrom has been reformed and kirbed throughout and, I trust, that this Street will by its altered condition operate as an inducement to the owners of similar Roads in other equally neglected localities, to put themselves by their contributions under the local authority until the time arrives, as I anticipated iu my last report, 16 when such authority shall have the power to compel the execution of these much needed works. Watering In reference to Road Watering, General Improvements, ments, &c. Building lines of Frontage, &c., submitted for the opinion of the Vestry by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and other matters of detail, these are so frequently presented to your notice by the Committees who have especial charge of these subjects, that I need not enlarge upon them in this Report, as they do not afford any material points for your consideration beyond what has already been laid before you. LIGHTING. Lighting. During the past year the applications for additional Lighting have received the careful consideration of the Lighting Committee, and the result is as follows,— 5 Additional Lamps 30 Alterations. Making a total during the last three years, of 178 Additional Lamps 147 Alterations. The number of public Lights and the Companies which supply the same, are as follow,— South Metropolitan 1139 Phoenix 56 Crystal Palace 6 Total 1201 Conclusion. To conclude this Report, I beg to add, although it may be considered that within the parish during the past year no 17 very important public works may appear to have been actually accomplished, still, as I hope I have demonstrated to you much is in embryo, which will ultimately tend to a further improved condition and a fulfilment of the requirements ofthe parish, so also with your own local matters which more immediately concern the Vestry, although it cannot perhaps be shewn that we have accomplished much that is patent to the view, still we can refer to the general condition of our parish as satisfactorily improved under the new regime, by the removal of much that was prejudicial to the health and property of its inhabitants, and we may believe that the steady progress of improvement daily going on will further develope the fact, that Local self government has not been in vain intrusted to its present possessors. As an instrument in your hands in carrying out the powers confided to you, I have again gratefully to acknowledge the kind co-operation of all with whom I act, and I trust that this co-operation is the result of your continued confidence in Tour humble and obedient Servant, Office of Works, J.

Gentlemen, The Annual Report which I have now the honour of placing before you, is naturally divided, like its predecessors, into two parts; 1st, that which has reference to the actual state of health of Camberwell during the past year; 2nd, that which relates to the means that have been adopted for the improvement of its sanitary condition. These two topics I propose to discuss separately, and in the order indicated. First.— In the 52 weeks which terminated on the 1st January, 1859, 1440 deaths were registered in this parish Of this number 688 occurred in males and 752 in females; 21 took place in Dulwich, 419 in St. George's, 470 in Peckham, and 530 in Camberwell. But the Camberwell sub-district contains the workhouse and two lunatic asylums, in the former of which 74 inmates died, in the latter, 121. And if these deaths, amounting collectively to 195, be subtracted from the 530 assigned above to Camberwell proper, we obtain the number 335, which more correctly expresses the comparative mortality of this sub-district. 537 deaths, or considerably more than one-third of the entire number, occurred in infants under 5 years, and 67 in children 22 between 5 and 10. 27 individuals died between 10 and 15 years of age, 32 between 15 and 20, 83 between 20 and 30, 117 between 30 and 40, 109 between 40 and 50, 115 between 50 and 60, 160 between 60 and 70, 129 between 70 and 80, 63 between 80 and 90, 10 between 90 and 100, and one whose age exceeded a century. 101 deaths are classified under the head of " violence, privation, poison, and premature birth;" 20 under that of "fever;" 7 under that of "dysentery and acute diarrhoea" (not of infants) ; 143 under that of "scarlet fever;" 7 under that of "small-pox;" 12 under that of "erysipelas and puerperal fever;" 126 under that of "diarrhoea, bronchitis, and pneumonia of infants under 3 years of age;'' 108 under that of "measles, hooping-cough, and croup;" 108 under that of "hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy;" 169 under that of "phthisis and other tubercular diseases;"and 639 under that of" other diseases, chiefly chronic." I may-explain that of the 143 cases included under the head of " scarlet fever" 14 were registered as diphtheria; and that of the 108 placed under the head of "measles, hooping-cough, and croup," 28 was due to the first-named disease, 51 to the second, and 29 to the third. 368 persons died in the first three months of the year, 307 in the second, 356 in the third, and 409 in the fourth. Several of the facts above enumerated require comment and elucidation. The mortality, it will be observed, rose from 1259, at which it stood during the previous year, to 1440. There was therefore an increase of 181 deaths; and it is obvious either that some new morbific agencies were in operation, or that some of those previously at work had grown in severity. Let us investigate this question. Now an increase of mortality is manifested not merely by the final results furnished by the entire parish, 23 but equally by the several returns of its constituant districts; thus, the deaths in Dulwich rose from 16 to 21, those in Caraberwell from 493 to 530, those in Peckham from 434 to 4/0, and those in St. George's from 314 to 419; or in other words, the mortality of the several districts increased by 5, 35, 36, and 105 respectively, the increase in the case of St. George's being disproportionately large. Again, the mortality among young children shewed a marked augmentation, 527 children under five years of age having perished this year against 430 in the year previous. In Dulwich the infantile mortality showed a slight diminution; but in Camberwell it. was increased by 13; in Peckham by 24; and in St. George's, again unfortunately preeminent, by as many as 63. Indeed, it further appears that although there was a general slight increase in the death rate for each of the decennial periods of life, this increase was much larger, not only in the case of infants, but generally among those under twenty than in those above that age. Deaths below twenty years were more numerous by 139 than they were in 1857, and amounted to a total of 603. Of these 8 belonged to Dulwich, a number exactly equal to that of the year before; 164 to Camberwell, an increase of 10; 244 to Peckham, an increase of 32; and no fewer than 237 to St. George's, an increase of 87. It is manifest therefore not only that the general death rate of the year became augmented ; but that the excessive mortality was limited in great measure to the young; and was most remarkable in the subdistrict of St. George's. If we turn now to the tabulated list of the causes of death, we shall find that while some of them produced as nearly as possible the same number of fatal cases as they did in the previous year ; some, especially among the zymotic class, presented great fluctuations. Deaths from diarrhoea diminished from 50 to 26, and those from fever from 24 to 20; but small pox 24 destroyed 7 lives instead of 4; measles 28 instead of 7; hooping cough 51 in the place of 30; and scarlet fever 129 instead of 44. Further, a disease termed diphtheria, which previously had either not prevailed or had been overlooked, made its appearance and numbered 14 victims. The most important agents therefore in increasing the mortality were measles, hooping cough, scarlet fever, and diphtheria, which together produced 222 deaths, or 141 more than they produced in 1857. And this statement is confirmed by the fact already pointed out that the chief increase of deaths took place in young persons, whom such diseases usually attack; and by the further fact that these diseases prevailed more especially in those districts in which the mortality is ascertained to have been the largest; measles for example, having caused 4 deaths in Camberwell, 7 in St. George's, and 17 in Peckham; hooping cough, 1 in Dulwich, 10 in Camberwell, 14 in Peckham, and 26 in St. George's; diphtheria, 1 in Dulwich, 2 in Camberwell, 6 in Peckham, and 5 in St. George's; and scarlet fever, 1 in Dulwich, 30 in Camberwell, 35 in Peckham, and 60 in St. George's. It may be added that the deaths were disproportionately numerous during the last 6 months of the year, and that it was also during that period that these diseases most prevailed. Now, although I have taken some pains to show to what causes our increased mortality was in great measure due; it must not be hastily assumed that my arguments go to prove a generally unsatisfactory state of the health of the parish. I have shewn you that our mortality was greater last year than the year before; but it must be born in mind that 1857 was a peculiarly healthy year, and therefore not a perfectly fair standard of comparison, and that the population had increased during 1858, on which account alone a somewhat larger mortality was to be expected during that year than during the previous one. I have pointed out that certain forms of zymotic disease were unusually 25 fatal, but it must be recollected that diseasees of this class present great and often inexplicable variations, and that their accidental prevalence last year may be counterbalanced by comparative immunity from them in years to come. And I may here mention, that according to the Registrar General's annual return, it appears that from a combination of no very distinctly defined causes, the deaths in London generally during the year 1858, were more numerous than those which occurred during each of the two or three years immediately preceding. Now if their due weight be given to the various considerations enumerated above, and, if further it be borne in mind that fever-deaths were both absolutely and relatively few, it will become manifest that the general health of the parish was little, if at all, inferior to that enjoyed during the two directly antecedent and remarkably healthy years. That our mortality as compared with that of other parts of London was not excessive is shewn by table 6, from which it will be seen that by making adequate allowance for increase of population, our per centage of deaths was less than that presented by London as a whole, or than that presented by either its eastern, central, or southern groups of districts taken separately. I am, of course, unable to give the per centage quite accurately, since its ascertainment depends on a correct knowledge of the number of inhabitants, a knowledge which is at present only approximatively attainable. But if our population has increased only at the same rate as that of the whole of the southern districts collectively increased between 1841 and 1851, it amounted last year to about 62,646, and the per centage of mortality was 2.3. If, on the other hand, our numbers multiplied as rapidly as they actually did multiply in this parish during the same decennial period, they reached 65,167 and the mortuary per-centage dwindles consequently to 2.2. One disease amongst those enumerated as furnishing materials for our mortuary tables, is a recent claimant for admission into 26 these tables; and has latterly, under its somewhat newly imposed name of Diphtheria, excited considerable uneasiness in the public mind. It has prevailed for a year or two past to a very serious extent in many parts of the country, and during the last twelvemonths has made its appearance, though with no very remarkable severity, in London. Camberwell has not escaped its influence, and I feel it my duty therefore to make some observations in regard to it. The disease, which is new only as regards its name, has no doubt been confounded in byegone times (as, indeed, it is frequently even now) with scarlet fever, with quinsey, and with croup ; but it has been recognised in France, where it appears to have been extremely prevalent, as a distinct form of disease for at least thirty or forty years. In our own country it has been much less common, but has certainly constituted several epidemics of what at the time have been regarded as malignant quinsey or sore throat, and has furnished occasional isolated cases of which I have myself seen two or three in former years. We have lately experienced, and have not yet escaped from, an unusually severe, prolonged, and wide spread epidemic invasion of the kind. The disease, though not scarlet fever, has a very close resemblance to that malady. It begins with slight feverishness and soreness of the throat; and very soon a whitish exudation, or kind of scab, looking something like wash-leather, forms upon the tonsils ar.d spreads over the neighbouring parts. If the disease progresses favourably the exudation begins after a few days to separate from the mucous membrane, soon becomes wholly detached, and the patient though generally much enfeebled becomes convalescent. If, on the other hand, the malady takes a less favourable turn, it may produce serious or fatal results in more ways than one; the inflammation of the throat may extend deeply, and produce mortification of the tonsils; the washleather-like exudation may spread, and passing down the gullet 27 prevent the swallowing of food, or travelling down the windpipe produce suffocation; or as frequently happens, the affection of the throat may go on favourably, the patient may seem to enjoy every prospect of ultimate recovery, and yet fall a victim to sheer and almost unaccountable exhaustion. The disease is one unquestionably fraught with very considerable danger, at the same time its attacks vary in their degrees of severity; and of course many who are affected speedily recover. There can be no doubt, I think, that it is to some extent infectious or catching ; and children appear to be both more prone to its attacks, and more liable to succumb, than persons of more mature age. The births during the year 1858 were slightly (18) iu excess of those of the previous year. They amounted to 2101. of which 1076 were of boys, 1025 of girls. They were more numerous than the deaths by 661. Second.— In the year which expired with the 31st of March, 1859, your sanitary officers have laboured continuously, and I may add successfully, as they have done in their previous years' tenure of office. The inspectors of nuisances under my supervision visited systematically 2557 houses, besides inspecting many nuisances entered in the complaint book; and the following are the results which have flowed from their visits, and the proceedings which have been grounded thereon:— 388 cesspools have been emptied, and 188 filled up and abolished; 177 water closets have been constructed and connected with sewers, and 189 drains trapped or cleansed; 62 yards have been paved or had their paving relaid; 286 houses have been cleansed and whitewashed, and 51 repaired; water for drinking purposes has been supplied in 56 cases, and to water closets in 30; 85 dust bins have been erected; and 567 miscellaneous nuisances, arising from pigs, drains, ashes, and other matters have been remedied. Many of the above improvements were effected through simple 28 verbal or epistolary communication with the parties concerned ; in 512 cases it was found necessary to issue formal notices, and in 17 these had to be repeated; in very few cases was there any need of application to the magistrate. 26 notices, having reference, however, to a considerably larger number of works, were uncomplied with on the 31 st March. 49 slaughter houses were examined; no applications for license were opposed; all had been whitewashed during the year, some several times ; and in eleven instances the paving had been amended. Several other matters also of more or less importance have at various times occupied my attention. In the first place, I have furnished you monthly with the results of chemical analyses of the waters supplied to this parish by the Lambeth, Southwark and Vauxhall, and Kent Water Companies; in order that by keeping a watch over them any repetition of the extraordinary conduct displayed by one of them a year or two ago might be prevented. The result of these analyses has been to show that the waters which they severally furnish are, on the whole, (though presenting slight fluctuations) as pure and wholesome as can reasonably be expected. In the second place, in consequence of representations which were made to me with regard to the conveyance of the corpses of children to cemeteries in common street cabs, I instituted an inquiry into the subject; ascertained the truth of the alleged impropriety and its frequency; made the matter public by an appeal to the magistrate; and though I learned by this means that there existed no legal remedy, still the result was so far satisfactory that the practice, as far at least as regards the Camberwell cemeteries, has been in great measure discontinued. In the third place, finding that small pox began to spread in certain districts of the parish towards the close of last year, and that it continued with increasing severity during the earlier months of the present one, I obtained the permission of the vestry to publish a hand-bill drawing the 29 attention of the parishioners to the unusual prevalence of the disorder, urging the necessity of having vaccination performed immediately on those persons who had not yet been operated upon, and strongly recommending its repetition in all cases in which a period of 14 or 15 years had elapsed since its original performance. This was followed by the appearance of a bill, issued by the Board of Guardians, in which the names and addresses of the appointed vaccinators were specified; and it is pleasing to be able to state, on unquestionable authority, that these proceedings were followed in a large number of instances by the desired results. The great extent, however, to which the disorder has prevailed, and the knowledge that its prevalence is in great measure due to the non-performance of vaccination, determined me to devise if possible some other mode of dealing with the subject of its prevention. And with this object I have latterly begun to have appended to the ordinary systematic returns of house to house visitation, returns of the number of unvaccinated persons dwelling in each house reported upon; in order to press the performance of the operation on those who have neglected it through thoughtlessness or ignorance, and to enforce it by the power of the law on those who pertinaciously oppose it. Lastly, almost all those houses in which deaths from diphtheria, scarlet fever, small pox, and fever were known to have occurred; and most of these in which cases of these diseases have been attended and recorded by the parochial surgeons have been submitted to inspection; their condition has been reported on, and such defects in connection with them as appeared likely to be prejudicial to health have, as far as practicable, been removed or obviated. In conclusion, gentlemen, I beg to congratulate you on the commencement of that important sanitary measure, the main drainage of the metropolis; and on the fair prospect which we now have of the final abolition of the cesspool nuisance, that great 30 abomination of civilized communities, and that chiefest source of danger to the health of large towns. I beg also to thank you sincerely for the kindness and consideration with which you have uniformly treated me during the whole period of my tenure of that important and anxious post, the duties of which for the past year I consummate in the reading of this report. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN SYEE BRISTOWE, Jun., M.D. London. Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. Assistant Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital.
