June, 1955 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to you my annual report for the year 1954 The population in the middle of the year, as estimated by the Registrar General, was 136,400, which is 2,000 less than in 1953. Registered live births were 2,168, an increase of 45 on the previous year. The birth rate was 15.9 which is the highest since 1949- It is somewhat difficult to know what influences cause a birth rate to rise or fall. Undoubtedly the fear of war and its incidence deters parents from increasing their family; e.g in 1939 the birth rate fell to 12.3 Prosperity and wealth might be assumed to encourage parents to have children, but experience has shown that the birth rate amongst wealthy families has been lower than among those who are less well to do. Probably fashion plays an important part Until recently a family of two seems to have been the desire of most parents. I think that there is a tendency now to have larger families Whilst it is generally agreed that it is undesirable to have an only child, I think parents should realise that a family of one boy and one girl has some of the disadvantages of the only child family, for a daughter needs a sister and a son a brother if a proper spirit of family completeness is to be experienced not only by the parents but also by the children The death rate was 9.81, the lowest that has ever been recorded in the Borough of St. Pancras and beats what was last year a previous record at 10.11 Infantile Mortality The number of children who died before they reached the age of 1 year was 39, giving an infantile mortality rate of 17.98, once again a record figure the lowest ever reached in St Pancras. This record infantile mortality rate follows the rapid fall which started in 1945, when the mortality was 44. In 1946 it was 38, and it has fallen more or less consistently until the latest figure has been reached Of the 39 children who died, 29 failed to live more than one month, and of these, five died of congenital malformation, four of birth injuries, seven of failure of the lungs to expand and five from prematurity. It is possible that some of these deaths were due to infection for recent research seems to show that it is far more prevalent a cause of death in early life than was originally believed. This short summary of the vital statistics of the Borough indicates that the year was a healthy one and that the progress we have been able to report i over previous years has been maintained The weather was in no way helpful. Rain fell on no less than 170 days This compares with 185 days in 1951 and 111 in 1949, these recordings being the highest and lowest respectively during the last ten years The total rainfall was 25.91 inches which compares with 32 58 in 1951 and 17 61 in 1949 The year was a dull, rainy year I regret to report that the number of motor vehicle accidents which was 11 in 1953, was 23 in 1954. Infectious Diseases Notifications of infectious diseases were considerably less than in the previous year Of most importance is the fact that there were only five cases of poliomyelitis notified as compared with 36 in 1953 In one of these cases the diagnosis was not confirmed. Census 1951 As an appendix to this report there will be found a summary in so far as it applies to St Pancras of the Registrar General s report for the County of London upon the 1951 census. Air Pollution During the course of the year considerable attention has been given to the problem of atmospheric pollution. The Borough Council was asked if it would combine with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in obtaining records of pollution throughout London Accordingly three recording stations were set up as follows:- (a) Highgate West Hill (b) Camden Road (c) Gloucester Avenue At each of these three stations recordings give an indication of the monthly amount of deposited matter and sulphur pollution in that particular area In order that the members of the Council may have a picture of the recorded results I show below in diagramatic form the comparisons between the three stations and the highest and lowest recordings in London both for deposited matter and sulphur. ii DEPOSITED MATTER—EXPRESSED IH TOWS PER SQUARE MILE SULPHUR TRI-OXIDE (DAILY ESTIMATION EXPRES3ED A3 A PERCENTAGE) It will be seen that throughout the year the atmosphere as recorded at Highgate West Hill was better as regards deposited matter and sulphur than either that in Camden Road or Gloucester Avenue and that in fact it approximates to the lowest recordings in London. The inference to be drawn from this is important It has been assumed that air pollution knows no boundaries and that unless a large district is taken little advantage will be gained by dealing with small smoke polluted areas therein. The Highgate West Hill experience does not justify this assumption. I am satisfied that in dealing with and remedying local sources of pollution much advantage will materialise in the area concerned. It will be seen that there is little to choose as judged by these scientific measurements between the atmospheres in Camden Road and Gloucester Avenue. This at first seems surprising for it is from the Gloucester Avenue area that most complaints have arisen of nuisance created by smoke and grit from the Camden Motive Power Depot The reason is probably this The prevailing wind, which is south west tends to blow pollution away from Gloucester Avenue, and therefore upon most occasions there is little to choose as judged by scientific measure ment, between the two areas On the other hand when the wind is in the opposite direction., then smoke and grit in large quantities is blown into the Gloucester Avenue area creating hardship and nuisance. It is difficult to estimate the effects on health of a small amount of pollution over a long period What is certain is that a large amount of pollution in a short time causes serious nuisance and brings very rightly a score of complaints. In addition to the monthly recording stations mentioned above two further daily recording stations for smoke and sulphur have recently been set up one at the Town Hall and one at the Highgate Library Observations at these two latter stations commenced early in 1955. Dealing with St Pancras generally a survey was made in 1953 This showed that out of a total of 222 commercial plants 167 were using oil or coke or to put it in another way 75% were using smokeless methods of obtaining power or heat it is probable that since that time the position has improved. Your sanitary inspectors are fully alive to the need for preventing air Pollution and are ever watchful of all business premises Complaints however are few and when observed are very quickly remedied without recourse to methods other than that of informing the appropriate person of the nuisance. There has been some nuisance from the Electricity Power Station in Royal College Street but I am informed that within a short period this station may be using oil exclusively instead of coal. The area which has suffered most from air pollution is the Gloucester Avenue area which abuts on to the Camden Motive Power Depot and I think it would be wise to record the various steps that have been taken during 1954 to deal with this matter. V On the 8th February a Conference was held at the Town Hall at which were present the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, the Town Clerk; the Medical Officer of Health and the Public Relations and Publicity Officer of British Railways The matters discussed were electrification the enclosing of the whole depot, and the possibility of coaling firing and servicing locomotives outside London In addition the possibility of using better types of coal and the conversion to diesel oil were considered. On the 16th February a letter was received from the Public Relations Officer in which he answered as follows the questions that had been put to him. (1) Can the London Midland Region say whether it is likely that the main line from Euston will be electrified within the next 5 10 15 or 20 years or more? Answer At the present time it is not possible to answer this question. (2) Can the number of engines serviced at the Camden Motive Power Depot be reduced by having this work done at a provincial depot such as Watford or Bletchley or even further out? Answer The answer in this case is in the negative. (3) Will the London Midland Region consider extending the covered accommodation at Camden Motive Power Depot modern ising the whole structure throughout and providing smoke purification apparatus? Answer it is not possible at the present time for this to be considered even if effective smoke purification plant could be provided at the Motive Power Depot. (4) Has the coaling plant at Camden Motive Power Depot been enclosed as far as practicable? Answer The answer to this is in the affirmative. In view of this letter the Chief Regional Manager of the London Midland Region of British Railways was invited to attend the Public Health Committee In reply he stated that because it was a matter affecting the whole of British Railways he considered that it would be preferable if a representative from the British Transport Commission attended and this was accordingly arranged. A special meeting of the Public Health Committee was convened on the 6th April for this purpose and the following conclusions were recorded. We have given very careful consideration to the views put forward by the representative of the British Transport Commission and in our opinion it became obvious during the meeting that the only complete solution to the problem was the electrification of the railway system No alternative method of really overcoming the nuisance was put forward although it is true to say that certain promises were made to mitigate the complaints In our view possible methods of dealing with the trouble are:- (a) Electrification. (b) The entire provision of diesel engines for shunting and long distance runs. vi (c) Sufficient provision of sheds to secure that all engines are fired, serviced and kept under steam in properly constructed sheds, with ducts and shafts to lead all emissions of smoke to a chimney wherein the products of combustion would be suitably washed. (d) The transfer of servicing to a depot outside London. The problem is of very great gravity, and therefore, we consider that steps should be taken to bring it to the attention of the Ministry concerned, and to ask for some definite information as to the policy of electrification. We recommend- (a) That the Minister of Transport be asked to receive a deputation from the Council to discuss the foregoing matters, and (b) That the Members of Parliament for the Borough be invited to accompany and support the deputation. Appropriate letters were sent to Mr Kenneth Robinson, MP., and Alderman Mrs, Jeger, M P., and to the Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, requesting the Minister to receive a deputation. On the 3lst May however the Minister communicated with the Borough Council to the effect that he felt no useful purpose would be served by his receiving a deputation at that time. On the 10th June a letter was received from the London County Council that it would support representations made to the Minister of Transport, and, on the 28th June., a further letter was sent asking the Minister to reconsider his decision. On the 7th July Mr Kenneth Robinson MP., in Parliament asked the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation why he had refused to receive the deputation, and the Minister's answer was to the effect that the question of electrification of the whole of the former London Midland and Scottish System was not one that could properly be discussed by the Minister with a local authority. Following some further correspondence, Councillor Miss E M Haworth, the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, informed members of the Borough Council at its meeting on the 28th July, that the Minister would himself visit Gloucester Avenue This in fact he did on the 31st August. On the 7th September a letter was received from the Deputy Chairman of the British Transport Commission stating (a) that the British Transport Commission were fully alive to the conditions which have given rise to the complaints and representations from the Borough Council and the Medical Officer of Health and are most anxious to do everything in their power to mitigate the trouble; (b) it is inherent in the essential work performed at motive power depots in preparing steam locomotives for the work they are required to do, that smoke must be caused; vii (c) every possible reasonable expedient will be adopted to allay the complaints. (d) the change to other forms of motive power is not sufficiently advanced to enable the Transport Commission at this stage to make any definite statement either that steam locomotives will be withdrawn from the Camden Motive Power Depot in favour of some other type or what period of time would be likely to elapse for any such schemes to be completed. Since that time the Report of the Committee on Air Pollution, under the Chairmanship of Sir Hugh Beaver has been published in which special reference was made to smoke caused by railways and also the Report of the British Transport Commission upon the Modernisation and Re Equipment of British Railways, which sets out the programme for gradually introducing other forms of motive power in place of steam. Further correspondence has ensued in order to obtain information as to the date when electrification of the railway from Euston Station will be commenced or, alternatively when steam locomotives will be replaced by diesel engines. The Borough Council has set up a Special Committee on Air Pollution which had its first meeting on the 9th December 195.4 These are some of the steps which the Borough Council and its Committees have taken to deal with the problem of air pollution and I trust it will reassure the residents of the Borough that the Council and its officers are fully alive to the nuisance which is being created and have taken every possible step to ameliorate it. Bousing Repairs and Rents Act, 1951 This Act, which came into operation on the 30th August, 1954, allows owners under certain circumstances to increase the rent of controlled property One of the conditions of a permitted rent increase is that the house shali be in good repair and reasonably suitable for occupation. The tenant can avoid the increase in rent if he can obtain a Certificate from the Borough Council to the effect that the premises are not in good repair and/or are not reasonably suitable for occupation having regard to the following matters:- (i) stability; (ii) freedom from damp; (iii) natural lighting; (iv) ventilation; (v) water supply; (vi) drainage and sanitary conveniences, and (vii) facilities for storage preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of water. The duty of providing these Certificates falls upon the Public Health Department and from 30th August 1954 to the end of May 1955, 282 Certificates have been issued. via I would say immediately that the Public Health Department is not concerned in helping a landlord to.put up rent, nor in assisting tenants to avoid such increase The Department is interested purely and simply in securing improvements in property so that it is fit for human habitation and will provide homes in which adults and children can live in a healthy manner. From a health point of view, success is measured not so much by the number of Certificates issued as by those which have been revoked, that is, houses where repairs have been carried out to meet the requirements of the Certificate. The following diagram shows the number of Certificates applied for each month, and the number revoked. Note A Certificate issued B Certificate revoked Of these 285 applications; certificates were refused in three cases. The number of Certificates revoked is small, but it must be remembered that in a large number of instances there has not been sufficient time for the necessary work to be carried out, and, in fact, in the month of May there were more Certificates revoked than in any previous three months put together. It must not be thought that a landlord can refuse entirely to remedy the defects set out on a Certificate of Disrepair, provided he does not increase the rent If any defect constitutes a statutory nuisance within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 or renders the house unfit for human habitation within the meaning of the Housing Act, 1936, the normal procedure of the Public Health Department operates to remedy such defects as are considered dangerous and injurious to health. ix Improvement Grants (Section 20 Housing Act, 1949as amended, by Section 16 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954) In certain circumstances an owner of property can obtain from the Borough Council half the cost of improvements to a maximum of£400 per unit of accommodation, Every such application for a grant is considered by the Public Health Department in order that the Borough Council may be satisfied that these improvements conform with the appropriate by laws and that the premises attain a standard of fitness for habitation in accordance with the twelve conditions set out in Circular 36/54 which are that the premises must- (i) be in a good state of repair and substantially free from damp; (ii) have each room properly lighted and ventillated; (iii) have an adequate supply of wholesome water laid on inside the dwelling; (iv) be provided with efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes; (v) have an internal or otherwise readily accessible water closet; (vi) have a fixed bath (or shower) preferably in a separate room, (vii) be provided with a sink or sinks and suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water; (viii) have a proper drainage system; (ix) be provided in each room with adequate points for gas or electric lighting (where reasonably available); (x) be provided with adequate facilities for heating; (xi) have satisfactory facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food. (xii) have proper provision for the storage of fuel (where required) During the year reports were made upon 53 applications for improvement grants. Loans for House Purchase (Section 4 of Housing Act, 1949) The Borough Council has embarked upon the policy of loaning money to persons who desire to purchase their own homes The Council must be satisfied as to the value of the premises and that such premises are or will be made in all respects fit for human habitation All proposals are now considered from the latter point of view by the Public Health Department. I would say that work in connection with the issue of Certificates of Disrepair Improvement Grants and Reports upon houses which residents desire to purchase has been welcomed by the department It is work for which the Sanitary Inspector is particularly skilled and well trained and the Department is glad to participate in these new branches of housing which are so important in relation to health. X Care of the Aged Once again it is my pleasure to report on the steps which are being taken to care for aged persons living in the Borough. The centralisation of this work is entrusted to the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Agedv a voluntary Association consisting of members of the Council and representatives of the various voluntary agencies in the Borough. It also receives most valuable help and co operation from the local branches of the National Assistance Board and the Home Help Service of the London County Council. The object of the Association is to protect the health of elderly persons living in the Borough and to bring to them a sense of friendship and happiness The fundamental work of the Association consists in visiting old people when they are well and taking such steps as may be possible to keep them so. The Association now employs three whole time qualified nurses who visit all cases referred to them as being in need of advice In addition, and this is their main work, they keep under observation all those elderly persons living in the specific parts of the Borough for which they are responsible, and it is our hope that they may thus by timely help and advice prevent much of that ill health and unhappiness of old age with which we have unfortunately come in contact It is still too early to judge the effect of this work and I would not like to go further than to say that I have some impression that the number of cases of distressing conditions referred to us tends to diminish. I can add little to the remarks and conclusions of my annual report to you for the year 1953 Insofar as statistics are concerned, the following facts will be of interest. 9,074 meals were provided to old people in their own homes This means that approximately 30 40 people were provided with five meals per week throughout the year. In addition to this 6 815 meal vouchers were issued to enable old persons to have a meal at a reduced price at a local restaurant of their choice When schemes for the provision of meals to old people were first considered the Executive Committee of the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged felt that the demand might be so heavy that it would not be within the compass of the finances of the Association to meet all the requests that would be made This, however, has not been so Meals in their homes are provided to those old people who are more or less bedridden or housebound whilst assisted meals in various restaurants are for those who are unable or have not the facilities to obtain a meal in their own homes Very few if any requests have been refused and the Committee have been somewhat surprised to find how few are the old persons who have required help in this direction. During the course of the year a wireless set was supplied to 30 old persons. At the beginning of June 1955 there were 80 wireless sets on loan and I cannot exaggerate the happiness which this side of our work has brought to the old people in the borough. xi Another feature which has been most successful is the provision of chiropody treatment Some five years ago we held one session per week To-day there is an average of 6^ The clinics are well attended and there is a waiting list. They are held not only in the south of the borough but also in the north and the following table sets out the position. Raglan Street No of clinics during 1954 94 No of new cases 171 No of re-inspections 799 Medical clinics 2 No of people seen at medical clinics 28 Prospect Terrace No of clinics during 1954 223 No of new cases 116 No of re inspections 2,360 No of medical clinics 40 No of people seen at medical clinics 515 It will be noted that the Deputy Medical Officer of Health attends alternate weeks at each clinic to advise on individual problems affecting the health of old persons. We now have some 500 old people receiving regular care of the feet to whom we are bringing comfort and the ability "to get about". The scheme for the provision of holidays continued as in previous years 136 persons were sent away for a fortnight's holiday at Margate The average age of those who went was 72.1 years. I have left to the last a very important aspect of the work of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged It is impossible to over-estimate the value of the hundreds of visits which have been made to old people by our voluntary visitors a band of some 60 individuals, each of whom visits one or two old people every week and advises me of their worries and their needs. The Home Help Service the District Nurses, the clubs for old people, and the various entertainments and amusements all combine to bring a sense of comfort and interest to old people and above all that feeling that their welfare is really in the minds of the voluntary associations and members of the Council The Council is making a grant of no less than £4 000 to the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged for the year 1955-6 In addition during 1954 the association itself raised £195 from Alexandra Rose Day, £200 from a dance, and received subscriptions and donations amounting to £237. Conelusion It now remains for me to express my thanks to the Council, and in particular the Public Health Committee for the help and encouragement I have received throughout the year I also wish to express my appreciation of the co operation I have received from the general practitioners of the Borough my colleagues who are Chief Officers and every member of my department. xii I would say once again that it is a pleasure and a privilege to work in a Borough and for a Council as progressive as St Pancras. The variety of problems which confront a Medical Officer of Health in this Borough are a challenge to his resources, his imagination and ingenuity No Medical Officer of Health could wish for a better opportunity for research in environmental and social problems No Medical Officer of Health could expect a more happy co operation from both official and voluntary sources than I have received in this Borough, and for this I am deeply grateful. It will be appreciated that I could not present this report were it not for the help of the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, the Chief Clerk and every member of my department. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, DENNIS H GEFFEN, Medical Officer of Health xiii METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.
