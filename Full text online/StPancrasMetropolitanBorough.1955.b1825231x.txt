June, 1956 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras. Your Worship Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to you my Annual Report, for the year 1955. The population in the middle of the year, as estimated by the Registrar General, was 134,500 This compares with a population of 136,400 in the middle of 1954, which means that the number of residents in St. Pancras has fallen during the year by 1,900 The actual census figure for 1951 was 138,377, that is, 3,877 more than the present population Infantile deaths numbered 50 - eleven more than last year. The infantile mortality rate was 23 per thousand live births, as compared to 18 in 1954. The death rate rose from 9.8 per thousand population in 1954 to 10.7 in 1955. These two figures of death rate and infantile mortality, considered alone, are somewhat disturbing. On the other hand it must be remembered that the population is probably ageing, and that a small number of deaths in the first year of life can influence very considerably the infantile death rate. The number of deaths in children under one year has varied during the last seven years between 39 and 70 hence a small increase influences the rate very considerably. In 1920 the number of deaths was 435, and twenty years ago, in 1935, it was 155. Infectious Disease (Measles) During the course of the year, 1,618 cases of measles were notified, as compared with 398 in 1954 Not one patient died. It is interesting to consider mortality from measles over the past few years Since 1950 there have been notified 7, 622 cases with only one death. Taking the years 1939 to 1955, inclusive, there were notified 17,529 cases, with 15 deaths Taking individual years, in 1929 there were 3,876 notifications with 127 deaths, and in 1926, 3,734 cases with 65 deaths What are the reasons for this very happy reduction in mortality from measles? It is possible that the disease itself is not as virulent as it was in past years, but I do not think this is the whole story There is a tendency now-and a very wise one to admit to hospital severe cases of measles or children from homes where the conditions are such that adequate care and attention is not available. Should complications arise, admission is always effected. The complications we had to cope with during the year consisted chiefly of bronchitis and broncho pneumonia though three children had ear trouble Probably the decrease in mortality is associated with a better understanding of the fact that measles can be a serious I condition in young children a condition which needs special nursing and care. I think that we must thank parents and general practitioners for the happy state ment that in 1955 despite over 1½ thousand cases of measles, there was not one death. Diphtheria Not one case of diphtheria was notified during the year It is difficult for me to estimate the percentage of children in the Borough who have been immunised, but I am satisfied that it is very high It is our practice during the year to co-operate with the health visitors of the London County Council, and to consider individually every child under five and to ascertain whether or not it has been immunised I should like to express my appreciation of the work of the health visitors, through whose efforts it has been possible to secure a very high percentage of immunity to diphtheria in the children of the Borough. Tuberculosis The number of notified cases on the register at the end of the year was 1,578 compared with 1,493 at the end of 1954 The new notifications amounted to 323 This number of new notifications has remained more or less constant for the past fifteen years It does not mean however, that the fight against tuberculosis is failing on the other hand, most of us can see a time when tuberculosis will be well controlled General practitioners are quick now to appreciate the significance of the signs and symptoms of incipient tuberculosis, and this fact together with mass x ray, is bringing to our notice a large number of cases in the very early stages of the disease stages when the condition is curable. This is reflected in the fact that there were only 34 deaths from tuberculosis during 1955. Between the years 1939 and 1949 the average number of deaths was 121 Between the years 1950 and 1955 this average number had dropped to 51 I would repeat a remark I have made previously, to the effect that many persons diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis who would have been given months to live some years ago are now being cured Admittedly the time of cure is still prolonged, but the outlook is certainly one of optimism. Poliomyelitis During the year 1955 there were notified 47 cases of poliomyelitis, and in forty of these the diagnosis was confirmed The following table and diagram show the position since 1946. Date No Notified No Confirmed Paralytic Non-paralytic 1946 3 2 - - 1947 36 15 - - 1948 7 5 - - 1949 65 44* - - 1950 25 20 11 9 1951 7 5 3 2 1952 27 23 8 15 1953 35 22 17 5 1954 5 4 4 - 1955 47 40 16 24 The total 44 includes 4 cases of Polioencephalitis II It is, of course, the confirmed cases with which we are concerned, and at first sight the fact that there were forty such cases is certainly disturbing. It must be remembered; however, that poliomyelitis is only a serious disease when it is complicated by paralysis If one could only be sure that individuals would contract a non-paralytic attack of the disease there would be little cause for worry, for such attacks result in recovery and the patient develops an immunity which usually lasts a lifetime. For this reason, second attacks of poliomyelitis, although they do occur, are rare. We are therefore most concerned with the number of paralytic cases which have occurred, as shown in black in the diagram above, (Prior to 1950 notifications do not distinguish between paralytic and non-paralytic attacks.) III It becomes obvious at once that there is considerable variation from year to year in the proportion of paralytic to non paralytic cases In 1955 only 16 out of the 40 cases were paralytic The incidence of paralysis and its nature and site vary from time to time and from epidemic to epidemic 1955 showed a large proportion of non paralytic cases both in St Pancras and elsewhere On the other hand, some few years ago the city of Copenhagen suffered from an epidemic of poliomyelitis which not only showed a large proportion of paralytic cases, but was the more serious in that those parts of the central nervous system associated with breathing were frequently affected. As the Council will know in America Canada and elsewhere attempts were made during 1955 to immunise children against poliomyelitis by means of akilled vaccine, and these attempts met with very considerable success It has been estimated that in some towns the incidence of poliomyelitis in vaccinated children has been reduced to one fifth of that which otherwise might have occurred In this country we are commencing immunisation during the months of May and June 1956 We are using a vaccine which we have every reason to believe will be safe and efficacious The last word however has not been said in preventing poliomyelitis by means of a killed vaccine Trials are still being carried out to obtain immunisation by means of a live but attenuated vaccine which can be taken by mouth This still does not answer the question as to why some persons infected with poliomyelitis become paralysed whilst others shake the disease off as if it were no more than a cold in the head or an abdominal upset with perhaps a little muscle stiffness. What are those factors which cause paralysis in someor, alternatively why is it that some persons avoid this complication? I hope that research on these lines will be carried out for the issue is wider than that of poliomyelitis It concerns many other diseases which are complicated by paralysis or loss of power of muscles During the course of the year an outbreak of infectious disease affected a group of hospitals in the Borough and in conjunction with the staff of the hospital, every attempt was made to investigate the disease and to discover any possible cause In due course a full report on this outbreak will be published in the medical journals, and I think it would be unwise if at this stage I did more than to refer to it, I think,, however I should inform the Council of the large amount of work that was involved by the staff of the hospital and the Public Health Department There could not have been closer or happier co-operation and I should like to express my gratitude to those concerned. The disease was to some extent confined to nursing staff It was associated with giddiness loss of muscle power and general malaise and there was a tendency for relapse to occur With few exceptions there has been recovery, and I am hopeful for the future of even those exceptions Once again I would assure the Council that in conjunction with the staff of the hospital both professional technical and lay I was able to carry out exhaustive investigations into the environmental conditions of those who contracted the disease IV Typhoid. During June a case of typhoid was diagnosed in a St Pancras resident who had returned from a holiday abroad This lady was associated with the hotel trade which made it all the more important to ascertain the source of the disease and prevent its possible spread, Her story was that she had travelled to Paris by air. and thence by coach to Spain, in which country she had visited several towns She was a member of a conducted tour The incubation period indicated that she had contracted the disease either in Paris or in Spain. Immediate steps were taken to ascertain the names and addresses of all the members of the party and I then communicated with the Medical Officers of Health of the districts in which they lived. As a result two other members of the party were diagnosed as suffering from typhoid, the type of typhoid germ being similar to that which had infected the St Pancras resident We were in contact with both the French and the Spanish Embassies in order that we should be able to ascertain the incidence of typhoid in the towns and districts where this coach stopped Altogether a total of seven cases were traced who had been to Spain during this particular period three, as set out above, in this very coach tour At one time it had been hoped to pin point the source of the epidemic to one particular restaurant in a town in Spain, but further evidence showed that not all the cases had eaten at this restaurant. The Council will realise that the investigation was widespread, and I would wish to express my appreciation to the touring company and the French and Spanish Embassies who gave every possible assistance. I also received considerable help and advice from the Ministry of Health and the Public Health Laboratories at Colindale to whom I am much indebted Mortuary and Coroner's Court At the time of writing this report work is proceeding upon the construction of a modern disinfecting station and mortuary It is hoped that this will be completed before the end of 1956 Plans have also been prepared for providing the Coroner s Officers and the public with better accommodation. Slum Clearance One of the most important tasks which fell upon the Department during 1955 was that in connection with slum clearance. Part I of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 requires the London County Council and each Metropolitan Borough Council to submit to the Minister of Housing and Local Government a joint programme for dealing with the houses within the Borough which appear to be unfit for human habitation This necessitated a complete inspection by our staff of the whole Borough which was duly carried out The scheme which was prepared by the Public Health Department included 23 areas consisting of 713 houses accommodating 3 501 persons. This scheme was discussed between me and the representatives of the Public Health Department of the London County Council in accordance with an agreement between the County and the Metropolitan Boroughs As a result of this a programme was prepared consisting of those areas which it was hoped could be dealt with within a period V of approximately five years. This programme consists of fifteen areas, comprising 349 dwellings and housing 1,764 persons. Further conversations took place between representatives of the County and the Borough in order that we might determine which areas should be represented by each of the two Authorities The final decision is that eight areas, consisting of 172 dwellings and housing 726 people, shall be dealt with by the Borough, and 7 areas, comprising 177 dwellings and housing 1,038 individuals, by the County. The programme has received the assent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The Council will be pleased to know that a start has been made upon the programme, and that one area, consisting of 39 houses and accommodating 241 people, has already been represented by me. and that the appropriate steps are being taken to effect the clearance of the area. Slums are cleared not only by representation, but also by negotiations and purchase of the area and the houses thereon. In 1945 I did represent some nine areas Discussions took place with the Ministry of Health, which was the body then responsible for slum clearance projects, and the Ministry suggested that so little time had elapsed since the end of the war, and so many owners might still be serving in His Majesty's Forces, that it might be wise to deal with these areas by negotiation and Compulsory Purchase. (Part V of the Housing Act, 1936 ) This procedure was adopted, and as a result, not only have many of these areas been acquired and the occupants re housed, but large modern blocks of flats have been erected on the sites in question. Air Pollution Work in connection with this matter has received the constant attention of the Public Health Department Records are taken as follows There are three stations where pollution of the atmosphere is assessed and recorded on a monthly basis, namely (1) Camden Road Rehabilitation Centre, N W 1 (2) St Pelagia's Convent, Highgate West Hill N.6. (3) Westminster Laboratories, adjacent to Gloucester Avenue, N W.1. These recordings show the amount of (a) deposited matter (ash and grit) measured as tons per square mile in one month, and (b) sulphur dioxide the amount being expressed as milligrams of sulphur trioxide collected per day per 100 square centimetres of standard lead peroxide The examination of the monthly recordings is carried out by the Public Analyst. In addition to these, there is recording apparatus both at the Town Hall and at the Chester Road Library, where recordings are on a daily basis, as follows: - VI Table 1 Deposit HIGHGATE WEST HILL CAMDEN ROAD GLOUCESTER AVENUE 1954 1955 1954 1955 1954 1955 JAN 10.78 23.41 20.12 35.43 27.90 43.00 FEB 16.61 10.07 37.68 19.88 43.67 27.01 MAR 117.53 15.63 33.60 24.00 33.83 30.01 APL 11.00 11.34 14.27 16.68 17.16 18.36 MAY 11.47 20.57 27.11 23.27 21.47 28.70 JUNE 12.13 17.18 18.13 17.11 21.16 18.45 JULY 15.08 8.17 20.04 10.97 23.56 22.40 AUG 16.49 13.17 20.92 14.17 21.22 20.74 SEPT 11.86 13.80 22.31 16.76 16.93 13.58 OCT 14.94 11.94 21.67 26.41 19.72 24.28 NOV 18.05 8.63 32.98 16.71 24.98 23.22 DEC 14.54 13.00 27.08 26.75 17.66 24.42 Table II Sulphur HIGHGATE WEST HILL CAMDEN ROAD GLOUCESTER AVENUE 1954 1955 1954 1955 1954 1955 JAN 1.77 2.05 3.32 3.84 3.53 3.98 FEB 1.48 1.70 3.59 3.20 3.24 3.26 MAR 1.70 1.35 2.93 2.64 2.78 3.78 APL 1.06 0.98 1.97 1.95 2.47 1.84 MAY 0.79 0.64 1.72 1.62 1.96 1.34 JUNE 0.66 0.67 1.15 1.23 1.01 1.25 JULY 0.38 0.54 1.23 0.86 0.64 1.35 AUG 0.44 0.56 1.37 1.17 1.02 1.36 SEPT 0.49 0.87 1.34 1.75 1.13 1.40 OCT 0.93 0.96 2.47 2.87 1.52 2.20 NOV 1.59 1.56 3.43 3.63 2.45 3.68 DEC 1.69 2.14 3.18 4.40 2.11 3.46 VII Once again I show in diagrammatic form comparisons between the three stations both for deposited matter and sulphur In the early months of the year the largest deposit occurred at the Gloucester Avenue area and this continued until the end of August, after which the deposit at the Camden Road area exceeded that at Gloucester Avenue It is interesting to note how persistently the situation remained better at Highgate The often repeated statement that smoke knows no boundaries" is not entirely correct, and is no excuse for doing nothing anywhere unless something can be done everywhere. In fact, even in small areas the prevention of air pollution has a decided effect. In July and August the Country enjoyed beautiful hot, sunny weather During much of this time the emission of smoke from the Camden Motive Power Depot caused very serious hardship to the residents of Gloucester Avenue The Council will be aware of the various steps that have been taken and the representations that have been made Three summonses were taken out against the British Transport Commission Two were dismissed, no costs being awarded to either side; to the third summons the British Transport Commission pleaded guilty, but no fine was imposed by the Magistrate, nor costs awarded I should like to be able to report that the situation is improving and that the present difficulties will be overcome shortly I cannot do this At the present moment I know of no steps, other than electrification and the use of diesel engines that are likely to ameliorate the situation and it must be some years before this takes place St, Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged For the past few years it has been my privilege to report on the steps which are being taken to care for aged persons living in the borough I do this in a dual capacity, as Medical Officer of Health and also as the Honorary Medical Officer to the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged These dual offices reflect the composition of the Association which consists of eight representatives of voluntary societies and twelve members elected by the Council The Mayor is president and the Geriatrician of the University College Hospital is a member of the Association. This combination has been a very happy one., for the spirit of a voluntary association has been preserved together with the facilities afforded by the Council in administration and organization. It is now five years since the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged was formed and I feel sure the Committee would like me to report the progress that has been made. Nurses In 1951 one whole time nurse was employed to investigate and advise on old people So successful was her work that further appointments have subsequently z been made There are now three nurses employed by the Association and authority has already been given for the appointment of a fourth. We have indeed been fortunate in the nurses who have served us and I would like to pay a tribute to the kindness they have shown in the carrying out of their duties. I use this word "kindness" deliberately for I believe that this is the quality that is most required They are welcome and popular and tributes are received daily expressing appreciation of the services they have rendered. It is not yet possible to employ them entirely on preventive work, that is, the routine visiting of old people who are well at the moment, and advising as to the preservation of health Much of their time is still spent in investigating cases of hardship both medical and social. referred to us by the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, voluntary societies, doctors, hospital almoners, and ministers of religion Although this work is essential, it is curative and very often directed towards circumstances which might have been prevented had we received earlier knowledge of the plight of the old persons concerned. The number of visits paid by our nurses during the past five years is as follows:- 1951 1,461 1952 2,494 1953 3,776 1954 4,383 1955 6,120 Voluntary Visitors The work of the nurses is augmented by visits paid by some 60 voluntary workers each of whom makes himself or herself responsible for visits to one or two old people, weekly if possible, and reports to me when help is required I have placed this work of the nurses and the voluntary visitors first because I consider it to be of primary importance The St, Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged does much to alleviate suffering and to make happier the life of old people living in the borough but the reason for its formation was to keep old people well and cheerful in their own homes, and this is achieved basically through the services of our nurses and the voluntary visitors. Invalid Meals Meals are supplied to old people in their homes through the medium of the Invalid meals for London The St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged makes a grant of 1s, 2d for every meal so supplied The number of meals has varied around a figure of 9,000 a year and for the last five years is as follows:- 1951 9,335 1952 9,914 1953 9,447 1954 9,074 1955 9,396 I think it is possible that the number of meals required may be increased in the forcoming year. XI Meal Vouchers There are however many old people who are unable to provide meals for themselves in their own homes yet are able to go to a local restaurant, We now have arrangements with no less than 18 restaurants whereat on production of an aPPropriate voucher an old person can obtain the main course of a meal at a Price reduced by the value of the voucher, namely Is. This scheme has increased 0ver the years, as is shown in the following table of the number of vouchers Granted free to those who need them on the above grounds. 1951 788 1952 3,498 1953 4,136 1954 6,815 1955 6,703 wireless It has been the policy of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged to provide a wireless set to old persons who are to some extent housebound 0r are living alone 39 such sets were supplied in 1955. The following table shows the number for each year:- 1951 22 1952 46 1953 34 1954 30 1955 39 The number of wireless sets on loan to old people at the time of writing this report is 91 I have referred in previous reports to the value of this service. It prevents that feeling of isolation and loneliness which old persons may suffer when their Ability is limited They feel themselves part of the community, have more to think about, and a continued interest. We have tried during the year to get a firm to undertake the servicing of our wireless sets In this we have been unsuccessful and have to deal with each defect individually. Chiropody The chiropody service has proved as popular as ever. In 1951 we held one session per week In 1955 we were holding 17 in every fortnight Originally the only centre we had was at Prospect Terrace Now we have divided the borough into two and the chiropody service is available in the north at Raglan Street and in he south at Prospect Terrace. Progress over the years is shown in the following table XII  1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 No of clinics 32 121 198 317 352 No, of new cases 136 138 215 287 282 No of re-attendances 215 1,198 2,534 3,159 3,866 No of medical clinics 27 52 45 42 37 No. of persons seen at medical clinics 266 521 509 543 452 Holidays We still continue to provide a holiday of a fortnight's duration at Margate. It has been my privilege and that of some members of the Committee to visit the old people at the home of Mr and Mrs. Greves during their holiday, and we can assure the members of the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged that the old people enjoy their holiday and are thoroughly well looked after. For this we are indebted to Mr. and Mrs Greves The old people pay according to their means but in no case is the payment so high that the holiday-maker is left without a sufficient weekly sum of money to preserve his or her independence on his holiday and to enjoy it During the fortnight's holiday local facilities such as deck chairs at reduced prices are available to the old people and half day outings are arranged to Canterbury Cathedral and to the hop fields. The number of persons sent away each year was as follows: - 1951 136 1952 128 1953 134 1954 140 1955 143 This makes a total of 681 individual holidays since the beginning of the scheme Clothing We have quite a moderate store of clothing which our nurses issue regularly to those old people who need help in this direction These are but a few of the benefits afforded by the St. Pancras Association for the Care for the Aged. They do not tell you the whole story Dr. Tracy and I receive every morning a number of reports concerning old people, prepared for us by the nurses These reports set out the age of the old persons, the conditions under which they are living and what is required to keep them healthy happy, and if possible, at home The list includes:- Home Help Wireless Invalid dinners Restraurant meals Clothes Bedding Voluntary visitor Holiday Chiropody Fireguard XIII The nurse indicates which of the requirements are necessary and I can assure the Council and the Association that it is very seldom that we are unable to provide them It is impossible for me to name all those individuals for whose help we are indebted, for so many are concerned The St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged provides a comprehensive service and it seeks to deal with all the needs of residents of retirement age It is supplemented by environmental care for often the help of the sanitary inspector and the Housing Department must be sought. It is the centralisation of the work and its happy administration that have made it so valuable an entity in the life of the borough I have said that the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged is a voluntary society This is not just a form of words for the voluntary contributions have increased In 1951 the amount of money raised was £223. 5s. 6d-no small sum for the first year of its existence By 1955 these voluntary contributions had risen to no less than £623 The following table shows the sum received year by year. 1951 £223. 5s. 6d 1952 £311. 3s. 7d 1953 £557. 12s. 9d 1954 £673. 7s. 5d 1955 £623. 3s. 8d The care of the aged is very human work and I am grateful both to the Council and the St Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged for my participation in it. Conclusion It rests with me now to thank the Council, and in particular the Public Health Committee for its unfailing courtesy and support, and to express my appreciation of the help and co operation I have received from my colleagues and the staff of the Public Health Department I should like, moreover, to pay a tribute to the general practitioners of the Borough and the staffs of the many hospitals situated therein No Medical Officer of Health could have a happier relationship with his professional colleagues in the Borough in private and consultant practice than I enjoy and for this I am deeply grateful I beg to remain.

Twelve samples of water were taken during the year and submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination. All proved satisfactory. 34 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT: 1933 The following applications were received during 1955 for retention or entry in the Council s list of persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part 11 of the Poisons List - Retentions 126 New entries 8 CLOSING AND DEMOLITION ORDERS The following is a summary of the work carried out during the year in regard to unfit basement and other rooms - Number of rooms reported unfit 87 Number of rooms closed for all purposes 67 Number of rooms closed for human habitation, but permitted to be used for other purposes 11 Number of rooms made fit without the necessity of a Closing Order 12 Number of existing Closing Orders varied to permit of use other than human habitation 23 Number of existing Closing Orders determined 16 Closing orders are operative upon a total of 1,317 rooms in the borough, of which bi-annual visits of inspection are made.

During the year I have been asked on two occasions to examine persons living in the neighbourhood who were accepting positions in Borough Councils elsewhere. I have carried out these examinations for it is the usual practice for Councils to help each other in this way on a reciprocal basis. The number of special examinations is stated as 8, but I would inform the Council that a vast amount of correspondence has to be carried out with private doctors and with hospitals to ascertain the fitness of members of the staff who have been off duty for some while. Di;. Tracy and I would like to thank the Staff Committee in particular for the kindness of its attitude in the reception of these special reports. The conditions we have to deal with cover a wide range of disease including cases of cancer, tuberculosis, diseases of the eye, surgical and medical conditions The Committee will realise that information we receive is of course entirely confidential and we can only give to the Committee medical details provided we have the authority of the person concerned. By and large we have to confine ourselves to stating whether in our opinion the person is rightly off duty, when he is likely to return and the extent to which in future he will be able to carry out his duties. We have been aware, however, of the Staff Committee s desire to treat sick members of the staff with every kindness and consideration and this has made a somewhat difficult task easier and more pleasant. The following table summarises the work that has been carried out during the year:- NEV, ENTRANTS Pit 85 Unfit 4 Total 89 Special Examinations Fit to resume work 1 Unfit for work 5 Unfit for work as dus tman 1 Unfit for work as slater 1 Total 8 The Total of 97 is made up as follows - Borough Council staff 55 Electricity Board staff 36 Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee 3 Valuation Panel 1 Examination for Leicester 1 Examined for Bristol 1 97 39 BLIND PERSONS It is the practice of the Public Health Department for Sanitary Inspectors to pay visits during the year to all St Pancras persons known to the Public Health Department to be blind with a view to seeing whether there are any sanitary defects which, on account of his disability, the blind person has failed to notice. Apart from this, we find these visits are welcomed by blind persons, who look upon the Sanitary Inspector as an additional friend., At the beginning of the year there were 58 blind persons known to the Department, During 1955 seven died and five moved from the district, but we received information of eight additional persons The conditions under which they were living were reasonably satisfactory, and in only one case was it necessary to serve a notice 40 SECTION 5 Factories The provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 are administered by H.M. Inspector of Factories of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, in conjunction with the local sanitary authority. Close co-operation is maintained between the two, and defaults found in the course of visits to factories are notified between one and the other according to the body responsible for remedial measures. The principal duties of the sanitary authority are the enforcement of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the Factories Act, 1937 insofar as non-power factories are concerned, and Section 7 only in respect of power factories. The requirements of these sections may be summarised as follows: - Section 1 Every factory to be kept clean, and free from any effluvia arising from any drain, sanitary convenience or nuisance, and lays down the frequency with which cleansing must be undertaken. Section 2 A factory shall not be so overcrowded as to cause risk of injury to health of the persons employed therein, Section 3 Effective provision to be made for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature in each work-room. Section U Effective and suitable provision for securing and maintaining adequate ventilation of each work-room, and for rendering harmless all fumes, dust and other impurities generated in the course of any work. Section 6 Effective drainage of floors where wet processes are carried on. Section 7 Provision of sufficient andsuitable sanitary conveniences, properly lighted, with separate accommodation for the sexes 41 Particulars of inspections and other work carried out by the Factory Inspectors during 1955 are given in the following table:- Number of visits - Factories (with mechanical power) 3,303 Factories (without mechanical power) 1,404 Bakehouses 243 Restaurants 1,107 Outworkers' premises 1,618 Rag Flock Act 31 Scabies and vermin cases 101 Smoke observations 266 Water sampling 27 Public Health Annexe 151 Other visits 5 Attendances at Police Court 3 Total 8,259 Intimation Notices served relating to Statutes under which served Factories Act, 1937 Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Food and Drugs Act.1938 Factories (with mechanical power) 221 24 1 Factories (without mechanical power) 27 9 - Bakehouses - 1 19 Restaurants and canteens - 1 136 Totals 248 35 156 Statutory notices served 23 7 7 42 The following particulars are furnished in accordance with section 128(3) of the 1937 Act,with respect to matters under Part I and Part VIII - Part 1 of the Act 1.

Failure to comply with this requirement renders the occupier liable to a fine not exceeding £10. The Council is required to forward the name and address of any outworker in this list whose address is not in St. Pancras to the local authority concerned. Section 111 applies to premises where work is carried on which, in the Council s opinion is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein, and in such cases the Council is empowered to give notice in writing to the occupier of the factory of the circumstances. If, after the expiration of ten days, the occupier continues to give out work to those premises, he is guilty of an offence, A Schedule to the Act states that if the occupier of a factory knowingly allows a woman or girl to be employed therein within four weeks after she has given birth to a child, he shall be liable to a fine. If the occupier of a factory orhis contractor allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned or repaired in any place where an inmate is suffering from scarlet fever or smallpox, and cannot prove that he was unaware of the existence of the disease, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10. The Council has power to forbid work being given out to premises where an inmate is suffering from an infectious disease, and an occupier or contractor upon whom such an order has been served shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10 if he contravenes such order. The industries contained in the list of trades inconnection with outworkers are as follows - (1) Making cleaning, washing altering, ornamenting, finishing, and repairing of wearing apparel; (2) Making up ornamenting, finishing and repairing of table linen, bed linen or other household linen (including in the term linen, articles of cotton or cotton and linen mixtures); (3) Making ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets, (4) Making of curtains and furniture hangings; (5) Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work; (6) Making of Electro-plate; (7) Making of files; (8) Manufacture of brass and of any articles or parts of articles of brass (including in the term brass any alloy or compound of copper with zinc or tin); (9) Fur-pulling; 44 (10) Making of iron and steel cables and chains; (11) Making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels; (12) Making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gearbuckles, mull in bits, hooks, and attachments of all kinds; (13) Making of locks, latches, and keys; (14) Making or repairing of umbrellas, sunshades, parasols, or parts thereof; (15) Making of artificial flowers; (16) Making of nets other than wire nets; (17) Making of tents (18) Making or repairing of sacks; (19) Covering of racquet or tennis balls, (20) Making of paper bags; (21) Making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper card-board, chip, or similar material; (22) Making of brushes; (23) Pea-picking; (24) Feather sorting; (25) Carding boxing or packeting of buttons, hooks and eyes, pins, and hair pins; (26) Making of stuffed toys; (27) Making of baskets; (28) Manufacture of chocolates or sweets: (29) The making or filling of cosaques, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, or similar articles or parts of- articles; (30) The weaving of any textile fabric; (31) And any processes incidental to the above; There are two types of outworker. There are those who take in work not only for themselves but sometimes fo;r the whole family and other individuals. Such a contracting outworker is really then a secondary factory owner and comes under supervision, not only as a person employing outworkers, but also as a factory owner. In this latter capacity the responsibilities of the Council will depend on whether he employs power or not. The other type of outwork is that undertaken by an individual in his own home, and probably a better term here would be 'homework'. There is little but good to say for such homework It fulfils a useful function, both for the employer and the worker, and offers some people, especially the housewife with one child the disabled and the elderly, a chance to add to the family income and increase domestic comfort whilst working at times convenient to the out-worker Weekly earnings vary according to the ability of the worker and the time that can be spared for the work There has been no evidence of overcrowding, and the conditions of the homes appear to depend not on whether the women do homework but on whether they are good housewives. 45 During 1955 no less than 811 people were on the register, employed in the following trades- Wearing apparel 530 Household linen 15 Lace, lace curtains and nets 4 Curtains and furniture hangings 11 Furniture and upholstery 12 Fur pulling 17 Artificial flowers 39 The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper 31 Brush making 3 Feather sorting 35 Carding of buttons 5 Toy making 27 Basket making 10 Cosaques, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, etc. 41 Lampshades 31 The number employed in the Borough during each year since 1950 was as follows - Year Number 1950 664 1951 573 1952 723 1953 766 1954 760 The following table shows the number of visits paid in 1955 and each year for the previous five years and a resume of the action taken Year Visits DEFAULTS *Failure to supply list Premises in an unwholesome condition 1950 1,750 4 10 1951 1,601 12 11 1952 2,008 12 45 1953 2.136 13 20 1954 1,766 15 12 1955 1.618 12 17 * In these cases the lists were forthcoming after a letter from the Department, 4 In each case the factory concerned was notified that the sending of work to the premises must cease, and the outworker was told by letter that this action was being taken owing to the unwholesome conditions under which he or she was working 46 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 This Act requires (a) the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used and (b) the annual licensing of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored Twenty-seven premises were on the Council's register at the end of the year and two licences were renewed in respect of storage for the year 1956. During 1955 the Council* s sanitary inspectors paid 31 visits to these premises and took 14 samples, as follows, all of which were subjected to the tests prescribed by the Regulations and found to be satisfactory:- Cotton felt 1 Coir fibre 3 Grey hair 2 Hair and fibre 2 Rag flock 2 Curled hair 2 Woollen mixture 1 Re-cleansed hair 1 47 SECTION 6 Inspection and Supervision of Food Particulars of the inspections carried out by the Council's Pood Inspectors during 1955 are given in the following table:- Number of visits to - Milk distributors 680 Ice cream premises 427 Slaughterhouses 12 Butchers' shops 878 Prepared meat premises 531 Fishmongers' shops 147 Fried fish shops 174 Fish curers' premises 46 Other premises where food and drugs are sold 1,560 Catering establishments 850 Market streets and places 743 Railway goods yards, warehouses 87 Attendances at Police Court 10 Re-inspection after Intimation Notices 181 Other visits 910 Total 7,236* * These visits do not include visits made for the purpose of taking samples.
