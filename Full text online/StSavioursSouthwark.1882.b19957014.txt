REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD FOR THE YEAR 1882-83, by THE CLERK, MEDICAL OFFICER, AND ANALYST; Also Account in Abstract of Sums received and expended by the Board during the same period. Printed in accordance with section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. Thames Floods. Incidental to the carrying out of the "Works authorised by the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Floods) Amendment Act, 1879, the question of Thames Floods has engaged the attention of this Board several times during the past year. The Board, as stated in the last Annual Report, had resolved that the inner barriers or dams erected to keep out the tide should be retained until such time, at least, as the new works had been proved to be a sufficient safeguard; but, about the date of such Report (June, 1882), applications were received for their removal, on account of the obstruction which, it was alleged, they occasioned, and on the assumption that in presence of the new works they were no longer required. The Board having no desire to retain them unnecessarily, caused a letter to be addressed to the Metropolitan Board of Works enquiring whether, in their opinion, the barriers could, consistently with the public safety, be abolished. To this communication a reply was received, stating that the matter had been referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee of that Board, who, after consultation with their Engineer, were advised that the barriers in question should be 4 retained until the efficiency of the new works had been tested by a high tide, thereby endorsing and confirming the views of this Board, who thereupon declined to remove them. The necessity for their retention was afterwards abundantly shown on the occurrence of high tides on the 27th and 28th October, 1882, on both of which days the tide rose to a height of about 4 feet 9 inches above Trinity high water mark, and but for the protection afforded by the inner dams the district would have been flooded to a serious extent. At each recurring tide the water forced its way through the new dams, the river wall, and the roadway of Bankside, in considerable quantities, more than two feet in depth being lodged opposite Emerson Street. It was, however, effectually kept in check by the inner dams, and no damage was done. Erected in the first instance at the suggestion of Mr. Arnold Goodwin, in the year 1876, these dams have been the means of averting inundations on no less than twenty-three occasions. In February, 1883, additional flood-works were, in compliance with notices received from the Metropolitan Board, executed by this Board at St. Mary Overy's Dock, Bankend, Rose Alley, Emerson Street, and Moss Alley, where, on the occasion of the high tides referred to, the chief imperfections had been found to exist. The Metropolitan Board also put down gullies in Bankside in direct communication with their main sewers, hoping thereby to carry off any slight overflow or leakage. Whether the means which they have adopted will eventually prove to be efficacious remains to be seen. This Board, as before stated, has no desire to retain the inner barriers longer than may be necessary; but, having regard to the experimental nature of the new works, the uncertainty of the shifting dams which have been sanctioned for the convenience of wharfingers, and the very serious consequences which would ensue in the event of failure, it does not feel justified in discontinuing them for the present. South Eastern Railway (New Lines and Wideninga) Bill. The South Eastern Railway (New Lines and Widenings) Bill, mentioned in this Board's last Annual Report, has become Law, having received the Royal Assent on the 18th August, 1882. The clauses which, at the instance of this Board and the Vestries affected by the Bill, had, for the protection of the local interests, 5 been introduced into it when before a Committee of the House of Commons, underwent considerable modification in the Lords, the Metropolitan Board having submitted to the Committee of that House, to whom the same was referred, other clauses for insertion more or less inconsistent therewith, and a strong protest was made by the Vestry of St. Mary, Newington, against the action of that Board in the matter. After careful comparison of the two sets of clauses, however, Mr. Burney, the Solicitor employed by this Board, reported that in his judgment this Board and the Vestries had lost nothing substantially which they had gained in the Commons, except a general power of supervision over the construction and maintenance of bridges and works of the Company over streets, &c., which power had been transferred from them to the Metropolitan Board. On the other hand, some slight additional advantages had been gained, e.g., powers to compel the Company to construct all bridges with parapets to hide the passing of trains from public view, and to enclose the ends of arches, recesses, &c. forty feet wide and upwards, not utilised for railway purposes. South Eastern Railway (Various Powers) Bill. The South Eastern Railway (Various Powers) Bill also passed into Law, having received the Royal Assent on the 10th August, 1882. It will enable the Company to acquire additional land on the east side of the passage leading from the Grove to Ewer Street, for the purpose of carrying out the alterations and improvements in that locality authorised by their Act of 1878. Charing Cross and Waterloo Railway. An Act was passed in the Session of 1882 authorising the construction of a Railway from Charing Cross to the Waterloo Station of the London and South Western Railway, the motive power of which is to be electricity; and in the last Session of Parliament a Bill was introduced to enable the Company to extend the proposed Line along York Road, Lambeth, Stamford Street, Holland Street, part of Bankside, and thence beneath the bed of the River Thames to a point opposite the Royal Exchange. The Bill provided for the appropriation by the Company of the under-surface of streets; the construction of ventilating shafts or openings; the under-pinning of houses or buildings; the acquisition of vaults, cellars, and parts of buildings without being compelled to take the whole; the diversion of sewers and drains; the diversion also of the Subway for foot 6 passengers in Holland Street, which subway is now maintained and lighted by and at the expense of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company; and other objectionable matters. The Bill made no provision for the lighting or maintenance of the Subway when diverted and reconstructed; nor did it define the mode of construction of the Line, whether by open cutting or tunnel; or impose any limitation or restriction as to the length of roadway that might be broken up at any one time; neither did it make any provision to compel payment by tho Company of parochial rates while the works were in progress, although a clause to that effect was inserted in their former Bill. The Board therefore resolved to oppose the Bill, and instructed Mr. Burnet to prepare and lodge a petition against it, with a view to its amendment and the introduction of the necessary clauses as suggested. The Bill was read a second time on the 9th April, and referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons. Mr. Burney had prepared briefs and instructed Counsel; he had also drawn up clauses, and was in negotiation with the Company for the insertion of the clauses, when they suddenly withdrew their Bill. South London Tramways. By this Bill it is proposed to lay down additional Tramways from the point of divergence of the existing lines in Southwark Street to Lambeth Palace Road, passing along the western portion of Southwark Street by a double line of rails, and thence by a single line along Stamford Street and York lload, Lambeth, where they will join the lines to Wandsworth and other places. In the first instance this Board objected to the proposed extensions on account of the narrowness of Stamford Street and the danger which was apprehended from the crossing in Blackfriars Road; but, on further consideration, having regard to the convenience which they would afford to many persons, more especially the working classes, gave its consent; the Company undertaking to insert in their Bill clauses for the protection of this district similar to those which were inserted in their Act of 1881, and entering into an agreement for effectuating an arrangement which had been made with them relative to the working of the lines in Southwark Street at the eastern extremity thereof near the Borough, and also for purchase of the carriage-way paving to be taken up in the construction of 7 the new lines. This agreement provides, inter alia, that the Company shall not run any Tramcars eastward beyond the principal entrance of the Hop and Malt Exchange earlier than ten o'clock a.m., except upon Sundays and public holidays, and that they shall pay the Board nine shillings per superficial yard for all paving stones taken up by them in the construction of the proposed lines prior to the commencement of the works. The Bill came before a Select Committee of the House of Commons, and was opposed by the London Tramways Company and the South Western Railway Company. After hearing counsel on both sides the Committee reported in favour of the Bill, subject to the introduction of clauses to meet the objections of the two Companies referred to, namely: (a) To authorise the Metropolitan Board of Works, at any time after the expiration of three years from the opening of the Tramways in Lambeth Palace Road and York Road, Lambeth, if they shall be of opinion that an inquiry should be held as to whether the working of those Tramways is prejudicial to the public interest by reason of their causing an undue obstruction to the traffic passing to and from the station of the London and South Western Railway Company in York Road, Lambeth, to order such inquiry, and thereafter, if satisfied that the same should be removed or altered, to make an order to that effect; (b) to enable the Commissioners of Police of the Metropolis, with the approval of the Secretary of State, by order to prohibit the Tramcars from passing along the York Road upon certain days and between such hours as they may think fit; and (c) for the South London Company's Cars to give precedence to those of the London Tramways Company at the crossings. Thus amended the Bill has passed the House of Commons, and is now before the Lords. The Lines sanctioned by the Act of 1881, excepting a short length at the foot of Southwark Bridge, were opened for public traffic on the 28th May, 1883. Blackfriars Road and HolbornValley Tramways. Plans were deposited in November last of Blackfriars Road and Holborn Valley Tramways, which Tramways were intended to commence at the terminus of the London Tramway Company's Lines in Blackfriars Road, and proceed over Blackfriars Bridge en route to Farringdon Street, City. The Bill was not proceeded with beyond its preliminary stages. 8 Electric Lighting. In August, 1882, an Act was passed intituled, "An Act to facilitate and regulate the supply of Electricity for Lighting and other purposes in Great Britain and Ireland." It empowers the Board of Trade to grant Licenses to local authorities, or to any Company or person with the consent of the local authority, to supply Electricity for public or private purposes. It also empowers the Board of Trade to grant Provisional Orders to local authorities, or to any Company or person for the like purposes without the consent of the local authority, but requires that the Orders shall be submitted to Parliament for confirmation. A License may be for any period not exceeding seven years, and is renewable on the expiration of that period, with the consent of the local authority, at the option of the Board of Trade. A Provisional Order may be for a term not exceeding twenty-one years. In the event of a Company obtaining a Provisional Order, the local authority may, within six months after the expiration of twenty-one years, or other shorter period named in the Order, to be computed from the date of the passing of an Act of Parliament confirming the same, by notice in writing require the Company to sell to them their undertaking upon terms of paying the fair market value of all lands, buildings, plant, &c. used in connection therewith. Eor the Metropolis the Vestries and District Board are constituted local authorities within the meaning of the Act. Pursuant to the provisions of the Act referred to, applications were received in September last from two Companies, namely, the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company, Limited, and the Jablochkoff Electric Light and Power Company, Limited, for the consent of this Board to their applying to the Board of Trade for a License for the supply of Electricity within this district; and notices were afterwards received from the same two Companies of their intention to apply to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order. Five other notices were also received from other Companies and persons of a similar character. Of these one only, that of the Brush Company, was proceeded with; the others were abandoned. On receipt of the various applications and notices the matter was referred to the Paving and General Purposes Committee of this Board; who, after very careful consideration and inquiry, reported St. Sabiour's District Board of Works. Dear Sir, Pursuant to the I beg to forward you by Book post, a Copy of the Annual Reports and Accounts or this Board to Lady Day; I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, Clerk to the Board. Board Room, Emerson Street, Bankside, Southwark. - 9 to the effect that, in their opinion, the whole question of the production and supply of Electricity for the purposes contemplated by the Act was in too crude and elementary a condition to justify the Board in embarking in an undertaking of the kind, and recommended that no action should be taken in the matter. The Board concurred in this view, and further resolved not to offer any opposition to the application of the Brush Company for a Provisional Order. In compliance with such application, the Board of Trade have lately issued a Provisional Order, authorising the Company to erect and maintain Electric Lines and Works for the supply of Electricity within this district, and the same now awaits confirmation by Parliament. If passed, the Company, will be under obligation to lay down wires in the Borough High Street within two years from the date of the commencement of the Order, and in Blackfriars Road and Southwark Street within the same period, on the requisition of this Board as the local authority. They will also be enabled, with the consent of the Board of Trade, at any time after the commencement of the Order, to include other streets within the area of supply. Hydraulic Power Company. In the year 1871, the Wharves and Warehouses Steam Power and Hydraulic Pressure Company obtained an Act of Parliament for the establishment of a system of applying motive power by hydraulic pressure to waterside and land cranes used for the purpose of raising and loading goods, and for working dock gates and other machinery. The Company have lately commenced to carry out the works authorised by their Act, and have laid down hydraulic pipes in Holland Street, Bankside, Sumner Street, and other localities. Their powers to break up streets are similar to those of Gas and Water Companies. Steamboat Piers. In October last this Board memorialized the Thames Conservancy Board and the London Steamboat Company for the establishment of Steamboat Piers between London Bridge and Lambeth Bridge on the Surrey side of the river, and for a service of Boats to call at Blackfriars and Westminster Bridges; but, although the Company would have been willing, the Conservators declined, alleging, in justification of their refusal, that the piers which formerly stood 10 Wood Paving. on the Surrey side were not used by the public, and new ones would necessitate the removal of many barge roads which were greatly needed in the locality of the suggested piers. About the same time a memorial was received from inhabitants of the Borough High Street, praying for that thoroughfare to be paved with wood in place of the existing stone pavement, and a deputation attended in support of the memorial. After careful consideration the Board were of opinion, having regard to the vast amount of heavy traffic in the Borough, that wood pavement would not be of sufficient durability; moreover, that the great cost of providing and maintaining it would render its adoption inexpedient, and therefore declined to accede to the application. Proposed New Street. In compliance with a memorial received from inhabitants of Bankside and neighbouring localities, this Board in April last applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the formation of a New Street from opposite Mason's Stairs, Bankside, to Park Street, in order to relieve the congested vehicular traffic at the waterside, and render that business neighbourhood more readily accessible than it is at the present time. The application has been referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Board for consideration. Ventilation of Sewers. In consequence of complaints from inhabitants of Gravel Lane of offensive emanations from the sewers in that locality, this Board, with the consent of owners of the adjacent property, caused Ventilating Shafts to be placed in connection with the sewers and carried above the house-tops, a mode of ventilation which appears to have been efficacious in abating the nuisance complained of. Water Companies' Charges. On the application of the Vestry of Paddington, this Board contributed the sum of thirty guineas to the fund which is being raised in support of an appeal to the House of Lords by Mr. Archibald E. Dobbs against a recent decision of the Lords Justices, in order to finally determine the question whether water rates should be levied on the gross or the rateable value, the point at issue being one of great importance to the ratepayers. Thames Communications. The Board affixed its common seal to a memorial urging the Metropolitan Board of Works to provide means of communication between north and south of the Thames east of London Bridge. 11 Protection of Minors. Also a petition to both branches of the Legislature, praying that the law for the protection of Young Girls may be amended. Delegates. The Board during the past year appointed the following members as delegates to attend conferences on various subjects, namely: at St. Pancras Vestry Hall, on the subject of School Board Expenditure, Messrs. Couchman, Hawkins, and Henley; at Fulham and Westminster, on the proposed Government of London Bill, Messrs. Hale, Rider, and Thorn; and to accompany a deputation to the Home Secretary on the subject of Overhead Telegraph and Telephone Wires, Mr. Thorn. Metropolitan Board Representative. The Board, at a Special Meeting held on the 13th instant, unanimously re-elected Mr. Charles Harris a Member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to represent this district for the three years next ensuing, his term of office having expired by effluxion of time on that day, and a cordial vote of thanks was passed to him for his lengthened and valuable services in that capacity.

The Board greatly regret to have lost the services by death of Mr. Urban Gardner and Mr. Edmund Baxter, and by retirement of Mr. J. W. Cathie, Mr. George Swain, and Mr. Josiah Hale, during the past year. Survey or ship. The Board have elected Mr. George Roper Norrish, of No. 18, Palace Road, Upper Norwood, to be the Surveyor of the Board in the place of Mr. Greenstreet. General. In conclusion, it may be remarked that the number of schemes in Parliament, and other matters of importance, which the Board have had to consider during the past year has been unusually large. Those for railway extension and tramways demanded the utmost care and attention on the part of the Board, and a great deal of time was devoted to them in Committee. The question of electric lighting was, perhaps, the most complicated and difficult which the Board had ever been called upon to decide. In addition to the various alternatives presented by the Act, each of which had to be considered on its merits, several applications were received from Companies for concessions to lay down wires and supply the district with electricity independently; but these the Board did not feel justified in granting without the security and protection which would have been afforded by the Act. W. H. ATKINS. Board Room, Emerson Street, Bankside, S.E. 23rd June, 1883. 13 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In this, my Twenty-seventh Annual Report, I have to express my thankfulness that we have not, as in the previous year, to record a period of intense anxiety, when we had to contend with an epidemic of a most formidable character, which at one time threatened to baffle our utmost endeavours to suppress it. The past year has been singularly uneventful in its character, and has been remarkable for the diminution of deaths from Small-pox and Scarlet Fever, diseases which we all believe to be more or less rife as we observe or neglect sanitary laws. Eight cases of Small-pox were removed by the Relieving Officers to the Small-pox Hospital at Deptford, and two by your Inspector to the Hospital at Highgate, and fourteen isolated and treated at their homes. Nine cases of Scarlet Fever were removed by the Relieving Officers to the Fever Hospital at Deptford, and one by your Inspector to Liverpool Street, and 14 isolated and treated at their homes. The cases removed by the Inspector were at the expense of your Board. In every case the utmost care was taken to disinfect with sulphur the rooms which had been inhabited by the sick, as well as all bed-linen and clothing which could convey infection. The owners were also required to lime-wash the houses. The following is a summary of articles disinfected during the year:—76 beds, 43 blankets, 150 pillows, 51 quilts, 34 mattresses, 47 rugs, 104 sheets, besides 415 sundry articles. Owing to the energetic action of your Inspector a vast amount of sanitary works have been carried out, among the most important of which are as follows:—In St. Margaret's Court, the houses 9 to 25, the water-closets were found in the basements, without water supply and without ventilation, producing, without the least doubt, serious injury to the health of persons living over them. The 14 owners were required to provide a constant supply of water, which was readily complied with. America Street, Nos. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 were in a filthy and dilapidated condition; the roofs admitted the rain, and the water-closets were most foul, the paving of yards was defective, and the drains untrapped. All these nuisances have been effectually remedied. Zoar Street, 34 to 56, several houses had no provision for household refuse, the paving in the yards was defective, and the water-closets at 48 and 50 were falling to the ground. These nuisances were also remedied. Edward Street, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10, the houses, yards, and water-closets, were in a very filthy condition, and the dustbins broken and destroyed. All this has been thoroughly remedied. The whole of the houses in Whitecross Street were inspected, and many of them were found to be filthy and dilapidated, the drains untrapped, and the paving defective. The premises are now in good sanitary condition. Albert Terrace, Surrey Row— hero was discovered a small brick drain covered with pantiles, running the whole length of the houses, and receiving the drainage from the water-closets and yards. Each house had a separate water-closet, from which the cxcrete fell into a small brick cesspool, about six inches below the surface of the drain. The closets were without water supply. Notice was served to remove the brick drain, and substitute an earthenware pipe drain, to fill up the cesspool, and provide water to the closets. The owners at once carried out the suggested work. In Boddy's Bridge, a brick drain was found, about three feet below the surface of the yard, in a defective state, and permitting the sewage to impregnate the ground. This has been remedied. Prince's Street, 11, 13, 14, and 15, the houses were dilapidated, the roofs and water-closets defective. Loman Street, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34, the houses were dilapidated, and the paving and water-closets defective. Orange Street, 51, 53, and 55, the water-closets were defective and without water; the drainage was defective, and the houses in a dirty and dilapidated condition. All these houses have been put in a proper sanitary state. For the more efficient ventilation of sewers, ventilating shafts 15 have been erected in Bear Court, Bear Lane, at the corner of Bear Lane and Gravel Lane, at the corner of Sumner Street and Holland Street, and at 31, Union Street. Two of the places mentioned are the property of members of the Board, who have kindly allowed the shafts to be placed on their premises. I trust the Sewers Committee will see fit to continue this work. The number of deaths registered in Christchurch amounted to 375, and in St. Saviour 315, making a total of 690. The number of births registered was 1,013, 505 occurring in Christchurch, and 508 in St. Saviour. The total number of births registered in 1881 was 1,009, there being only a difference of four births in this year. The births were comprised in the following details:— Christchurch Males 267 Females 238 505 St. Saviour Males 251 Females 257 508 1,013 Eighty-two deaths occurred in the Christchurch Workhouse; 65 of this number were deaths of people over 60 years of age, there being 54 between 60 and 80 years of age, and 11 over 80 years. The following is a statement of all the deaths which occurred from various causes during the year:— 16 DISEASES. CHRISTCHURCH. ST. SAVIOUR. Totals. Totals.

In my report last year I stated that much of the water was rendered unfit for domestic purposes by being received in cisterns and butts containing organic deposits. I stated the remedy will be found in the establishment of the constant supply system. It should, however, be understood that the constant supply does not mean an unlimited supply, nor is it the fact that the water in the house-pipes is always in direct communication with the water in the reservoirs. / The arguments against the storage system are, I admit, directed against removable failures. If every house had a good cistern, in a proper place, that is, secured from contamination and capable of easy inspection and cleansing, it might be argued that storage on the premises would be the best plan, as giving without fail, and at all times, a sufficient supply of water, not merely for common use, but for emergencies. It must, however, be confessed that, especially in poor houses, the inspection and cleansing of a wellplaced cistern will never be properly done, and that, with all precautions, the chances of contamination of the water during storage are very great. Frequent examinations of the water of the Lambeth and Southwark and Vauxhall Companies show that it has been of fair quality, and the supply has been abundant. Gas Examination. I have thought it right in this report to bring under your notice 19 the causes of bad lighting, complaints of which have, from time to time, been made at this Board. Bad lighting may result from one or all of four causes:— 1st. The service-pipe from the Company's main may be old and too small in area to meet the requirements for gas on the part of the consumer, either because it has become internally rusted and corroded, or because the consumer has greatly increased the number of lights in his premises. This cause would operate more intensely if the gas meter was insufficient in size. 2nd. The internal pipes of the house may, in like manner, and for the same reasons as above stated, have become too small for proper delivery of gas. 3rd. The burners used may be such as to develop only onethird to two-thirds of the effective lighting power of the gas, either because they are ill-proportioned, or because they have been too long a time in use, and have become altered in their emission opening. 4th. With flat flames enclosed in globes much light is obstructed when the bottom openings of the globes are small, they cause too quick a draught and render combustion less perfect, and cause flickering and a lesser development of light from the gas burner. The average of my observations made during the year gave an illuminating power always exceeding 16 sperm candles; the proportion of Ammonia never reached the prescribed quantity of 2.5 grains for 100 cubic feet of gas. Sulphuretted hydrogen was never detected. I would ask your attention to the table of Sanitary work which has been so ably carried out under the direction of your Inspector, and I beg to thank every Member of the Board for the patience with which they have listened to, I fear, a somewhat tedious lleport. 20 Notices served and work done for the abatement of nuisances for the year 1882.

Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital, Gentlemen, Sept. 27th, 1882. I am pleased to be able to report a distinct improvement in the quality of Milk. This is only what we have a right to expect at this season, but the fact remains. Nevertheless, we have to report two very bad cases of adulteration with respectively 30 and 24 per cent. of water. Several of the milks were of excellent quality, bat for the most part they have received that small addition of water of which no account is given, and which necessitates the boiling of all milk intended for the nourishment of young children. The analysis of milk admits the chemist into the secret, and, therefore, explains why some customers receive the cream. If I may judge from my experience, it is because the milk is sold without being stirred. We have had milks this last quarter with 13 per cent. of cream, and 5 per cent. of added water. Surely a milkman should know his business better than this! In consequence of what has been said upon the subject of American Cheese, I have, through our Inspector, obtained three samples, and have no hesitation in stating that they were of excellent quality, and of very uniform composition. This may be judged from the following table:— Analysis of American Cheeses. No. 62 No. 63 No. 64 Water and Volatile Acids 35.58 36.01 35.44 Fat* 33.71 32.70 31.67 Curd 19.18 18.99 16.30 Extractive, soluble in water 7.79 7.88 12.29 Salt 1.33 1.63 1151 Ash, mainly Phosphates 2.41 2.49 2.55 Other mineral matter — 0.30 0.24 100.00 100.00 100.00 *The Fat melts at 34° 33°.5 32°.5 Density of Fat 0.9106 0.9117 0.9115 Insoluble Fatty Acids.. 89.14% 87.65% 90.27% Thus it will be seen that the fat is distinctly butter-fat. 22 Two Lards of excellent quality have been examined; also two Butters, one of which was adulterated. As I thought it advisable to look into tinned articles, I have taken this quarter two Potted Meats and two Extracts of Meat. Both the potted ham and the potted bloater-paste were of excellent quality. The bloater-paste was colored with a little oxide of iron, as the public will have it so. There is no adulteration, as the fact is stated upon the label, and is confirmed by analysis. It seems that the attempt to 6ell the bloater-paste without the coloring matter has failed, and as the appearance of the paste without the color is not so agreeable to the eye, the color added is the least objectionable. Both of the meat extracts are good. Number 51 is the better of the two. They are excellent stimulants, and best adapted for admixture with weak beef-tea. In households where soups are a common feature of the dinner-table, the introduction of such extracts would be a real economy. They contain no albumen, and this should be supplied, when necessary, by fresh meat. A Lime Juice, Number 70, was of very agreeable character. The analysis of two Drugs, called White Precipitate, concludes my list. One of them, No. 59, was perfect in composition; the other, No. 60, varied from the theoretical standard. As no fixed standard is given in the Pharmacopoeia, I, of course, took no notice of the discrepancy. All the certificates are in the hands of your Inspector, whom I have found intelligent, active, and willing. As usual, I have received every assistance and advice from your Medical Officer. Dee. 19 th, 1882. I have to present my usual Quarterly Report, and am sorry that it is not favorable as regards milk. The number of Milks analysed, eleven, must be considered very small for so poor a district as is represented by a portion of the St. Saviour's District Board, and yet the amount of adulteration is very high. We have five milks with respectively 10, 13, 10, 22, and 32 per cent. of added water. Another milk had been doctored by the addition of carbonate of soda to the extent of 12 6 grains per gallon, and obviously with the intent of using stale milk, but as the milk could not be considered watered, and the addition has been recommended by some in order to make it keep better, no action could be taken. On a former occasion the same 23 vendor had added at the rate of no less than 87½ grains per gallon; if it had been forwarded as a sample under the Act, we might have tried the legality of the addition. Of four samples of Butter analysed, one sample has been found to contain one-third of its weight of a fat other than butter-fat. Two Breads and two Cheeses, as also one Mustard, have been examined; they were fairly of the nature and quality demanded. A sample of Oatmeal was very good of its kind, but contained considerable admixture with wheaten flour; I regarded the admixture as accidental. The nutritious character of the meal may be inferred from the presence of 2.44 per cent. of nitrogen. A sample of Corn-flour, brought to me by our Inspector, I should have reported as not of the nature and quality demanded, if I had not seen the label sold with the article. If used as the label directs, nothing can be urged against it. Good milk would supply what the flour lacks. But, if judged by the name, the amount of nutriment offered may be inferred from the quantity of nitrogen in it, which is equal to 009 per cent., or about 1/27 the value of the oatmeal. Three Mercurial Ointments have been analysed. As two of these were sold simply as mercurial ointments, and as a mild kind of mercurial ointment is commonly sold, as well as the one mentioned in the Pharmacopoeia, no exception could be taken to the diminished quantity of mercury in the respective ointments. The sample of Unguentum Hydrargyri Nitratis was well made and of the nature and quality demanded. March 22nd, 1883. During the past quarter I have analysed ten Milks, only two of which were adulterated to any extent. On the whole there is a distinct improvement in their quality. On the subject of Butter, my mind has been somewhat exercised. Of five butters which I have analysed, four were genuine, and one I unhesitatingly pronounced adulterated, and so consider to this hour. It was not a case of gross adulteration, only to the extent of 20 per cent. of the fat in the butter. In my certificate I stated that it was not admixed by the vendor, and that the so-called butter was clean, of fair odour, and of good taste. The water was under the admitted quantity by more than five per cent., and so the amount of adulteration is still further reduced. By an analysis, in duplicate, I found the amount of insoluble fatty acids to be 90.34 per cent. Calculated upon a 24 rigid standard, I do not allow for one moment that my opinion of the results was incorrect. A margin has been allowed by the Chemists of Somerset House, which I shall be obliged to accept until it is altered. What we complain of is this: that the Authorities of Somerset House give an opinion without any analysis, so that we are unable to judge of the value of their opinion. I gave a full analysis. The Chemists of Somerset House simply stated that, from the results of a full analysis, we are of opinion that the butter is genuine. If we had been represented by a lawyer, I believe the magistrate would not even have allowed the expense of the analysis, as he clearly saw my point after the adjudication of the second case in which Somerset House had confirmed my analysis. In the case of milks, we know something of the opinions of the Authorities, although as Public Analysts we deny their premisses; and, in the case of butters, I know not what allowances must be made. A sample of Lard and a sample of Dripping were both of the nature and quality demanded. The dripping was not quite as clean as it might have been. Of two Breads, one sample gave indications of the presence of alum. The quantity amounted only to 5.2 grains per four-pound loaf. My information upon the subject of Corn-flours is now sufficient for all practical purposes. The two which have been analysed contain so little nitrogen that for infants' food they must be made up according to the directions, with milk, or they could not support life. Coffees, two in number, were genuine. So also was a Mustard and a Pickled Cabbage. The certificates are all in the hands of your Inspector. 18th June, 1883. I propose to take a rapid survey of the analytical work done by your Analyst during the past twelvemonth, and I am glad to be able on the whole to report progress. Milks, of course, occupy the first place; 44 have been examined, of which 10 were very considerably adulterated with from 10 to 32 per cent. of water. This means upwards of 22½ per cent. of adulteration. Carbonate of Soda has been somewhat extensively employed, in order to prevent the souring of the milk; in one case we have had as much as 87½ grains per gallon. 25 Of 14 Butters, only one was found to be altogether a made-up article. Two of them were adulterated with from 30 to 40 per cent. of fat other than butter-fat. One other with 20 per cent. of added fat was pronounced by Somerset House to be genuine. The water in the butter was more than five per cent. under the admitted quantity, and this, of course, further reduced the amount of adulteration. The amount of insoluble fatty acids I found to be 90⅓ per cent. of the fat, and, calculated by our standard, I have no doubt that the butter was adulterated. The standard of Somerset House is different from that of the Society of Public Analysts, and I shall be obliged to accept such standard until it is altered. In consequence of what has been said upon the subject of American Cheese, five samples have been taken by our Inspector. I have no hesitation in pronouncing them of excellent quality and of very uniform composition. This may be judged from the following table:— No. 62 No. 63 No. 64 Water and volatile acids 35.58 36.01 35.44 Fat* 33.71 32.70 31.67 Curd 19.18 18.99 16.30 Extractive, soluble in water 7.79 7.88 12.29 Salt 1.33 1.63 1.51 Phosphates 2.41 2.49 2.55 Other mineral matters — 0.30 0.24 100.00 100.00 100.00 *The Fat melted at 34° 33°.5 32°.5 Density of the Fat 0.9106 0.9117 0.9115 Insoluble fatty acids 89.14% 87.65% 90.27% Thus it will be seen that the fat is somewhat altered butter-fat. Pour samples of Lard have been examined; they were distinctly of the nature and quality demanded. The same may be said of a Dripping, except that it was not so clean as it might have been. Of seven Breads only one gave distinct indications of alum, but even in this one the alumina, calculated as alum, only amounted to 51/10 grains per four-pound loaf. Several of the breads were very dark in color, but not made of other than wheaten flour. Our information upon the subject of so-called Corn-flours is now sufficient for all practical purposes. Of the three which have been analysed, I should unhesitatingly have reported that they were not of the quality demanded if I had not seen the label sold with the article. If used as the label directs, nothing can be urged against them. Good milk would supply what the so-called corn-flour lacks; but, if judged by the name, the amount of nutriment offered may be inferred from the quantity of nitrogen contained in it, which is equal to 0.09 per cent., or about 1/27 the 26 value of oatmeal. If used for infants' food, unless, as directed, made up with milk, they could not support life. A sample of Oatmeal was very good of its kind, but contained considerable admixture with wheaten flour. I regarded the admixture as accidental. The nutritious character of the meal may be inferred from the presence of 2.44 per cent. of nitrogen. Coffees, three in number, were genuine. So also was a Mustard, a Pickled Cabbage, and a Lime Juice. Of tinned articles, two Potted Meats and two Extracts of Meat have been analysed. Both the potted ham and the bloater-paste were of excellent quality. The bloater-paste was colored with oxide of iron, as the public will have it so. This is no adulteration, as the fact is stated on the label, and is confirmed by the analysis. It seems that the attempt to sell the bloater-paste without the coloring matter has hitherto failed, and as the appearance of the paste without the color is not so agreeable to the eye, the color added is the least objectionable. Both of the meat extracts were good; No. 51 is the better of the two. They are excellent stimulants, and best adapted for admixture with weak beef-tea. In households where soups are a common feature of the dinner-table, the introduction of such extracts would be a real economy. They contain, however, no albumen, and this should be supplied, when necessary, by fresh meat. Of Drugs, two called White Precipitate, and three Mercurial Ointments deserve mention. One sample of white precipitate, No. 59, was perfect in composition; the other, No. 60, varied from the theoretical standard. As no fixed standard is given in the Pharmacopæia, I, of course, took no notice of the discrepancy. As two of the mercurial ointments were sold simply as such, and as a mild kind of mercurial ointment is commonly sold, as well as the one mentioned in the Pharmacopæia, no exception could be taken to the diminished quantity of mercury in the respective ointments. The sample Bold as Unguentum Hydrargyri Nitratis was well made, and of the nature, substance, and quality demanded. Three Spirits, a Gin, a Whiskey, and a sample of Rum, conclude my list. All three were up to the standard of the Act of Parliament. They were quite free from metallic contamination. In conclusion, may I express the belief that the information supplied by the Annual Report will be found of general service, and will justify the appointment of a Public Analyst. 27 Midsummer, 1883. During the past quarter I have analysed 12 Milks. One of them was adulterated with 15 per cent. of water, two of them with respectively five per cent. each, accepting the lowest possible standard. The great majority were very good. Of five Butters, four were genuine, according to our standard. One contained no butter at all, but was altogether an imitation. A sample of Lard was very good, and, in every sense of the word, of the nature, substance, and quality demanded. Three Breads have also been examined; they were not adulterated, but they ought to be very cheap. They were very dark in color, especially the one labelled 44. A sample of Coffee was distinctly good. Three Spirits conclude my list. All three were more than up to the mark as regards the alcoholic standard. None contained any metallic contamination; No. 50, Rum, was otherwise, of inferior quality. The certificates are in the hands of your Inspector. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. 28 29 ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT BOARD OF WORKS.
