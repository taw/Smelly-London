PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 2, SHALSTON VILLAS SURBITON. July, 1957. To the Layor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. annual Report 1956. Mr Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1956. The Report is on a similar pattern to that for previous years and follows the general lines indicated by the Minister of Health with special reference to Ministry of health Circular 19/56. The year covered is the first year of my office as your Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Linzee my predecessor having retired at the end of 1955 after serving 34 years in the office. I wish to say immediately how grateful I am for the friendly and encouraging way I was welcomed into office by all concerned, The Mayor and Mayoress, Aldermen and Councillors, my fellow chief officers led by the Town Clerk, and associated voluntary organisations. I would like also to record the very high standards found practised in the Public health Department led by Mr Eldridge, Chief Public Health Inspector. It is my intention to discharge my duties as Medical Officer of Health with due regard to present day community needs. In the physical field many of the old enemies of the public health have been vanquished or held at bay, and new discoveries have given us weapons to deal with others. The application of these new discoveries, prevention by immunisation and vaccination, is a very important part of the present day task. alongside this task is the ever. urgent one of Education in Health of all sections of the community. Indeed this is of chief importance because in all our work we depend on the willing co.operation of the people rather than the enforcement of penalties, though these are sometimes necessary. More and more it is realised that breakdown of health and loss of work is due to mental health or inefficiency, with social factors or faulty human relationships as contributary causes. The Medical Officer of Health is expected to take regard to all factors affect. community health and so Social Medicine becomes as important as the more familiar Public Health and Preventive Medicine of the past. Surbiton is very favourably endowed in regard to physical features, and can still retain its amenities if the rapid new housing development is strictly controlled and not allowed to disregard the amenity need for careful spacing. Population: The home population is given by the Registrar. general as 62,610, an increase of 40 on the figure for 1955 and continuing the trend of recent years. The population more than doubled during the intercensus period 1931.1951. At the 1951 census there were 28,501 males and 32,374 females with a density 2 of 12.9 persons per acre. The population is on the whole well housed. The 1951 census showed 17.,.640 separate dwellings which was an increase of 126% on the 1931 figures, with 4.8 rooms to the dwelling on the average as compared with 5.79 rooms per dwelling in 1931. The actual households of families were 18,965, an increase of 127% with l4.6% sharing a dwelling and 4.38 rooms per household. . 11.4% of the population occupied one or two rooms only, and the average number of persons per household was 3.14 compared with 3.51 in 1931, and 9.4% as one person households. The density of occupation per room generally was 0.72. There has been a considerable movement into Surbiton from surrounding areas and in common with the rest of Surrey, Surbiton receives a fair proportion of residents of British Overseas and Foreign origin. Another important feature of the population is demonstrated by the,numbers, considerably above the average for the country as a whole, of the population having advantages of full time advanced education. This fact emphasises the pressing need in this area for Grammar School, Technical College, Art School and University Places. the Registrar general divides population into five broad groups and classes, and from the following short statement it is seen how classes I, it and III preponderate. Glass I Professional, etc. Occupations Class II Intermediate Occupations Class III Skilled Occupations Class IV Partly Skilled Occupations Class V Unskilled Occupations. Social Class (per thousand; I II III IV V SURBITON 88 . 237 529 71 75 England and 7/ales 33 . 150 527 162 . 128 These facts on the constitution of the population have a direct bearing on the community needs and behaviour. Infectious Disease: The number of infectious disease notifications received in 19.56 was 686 which is 1+83 lower than in 1955 , the decrease mainly being due to the large fall in metsLes notifications. There was a considerable outbreak of Sonne Dysentery reaching 289 notifications. This outbreak involved the Department in an .enormous amount of work which was strongly persisted in with the result that the outbreak was kept in bounds and finally brought to an end. Grateful acknowledgement is due to the Public Health Inspectors, the Doctors, Parents, Teachers and to Dr. Stone at the Public Health Laboratory at Epsom for their combined efforts in this work. No case of Diphtheria was notified for the eleventh year in succession, and further progress was made in the active immunisation of the child population against this deadly and disabling disease. It is very necessary to.keep up propaganda in favour of immunisation . 3 . Infectious Disease: (Contd). immunisation because now we have a generation of parents and. doctors who have not known diphtheria as one of the common infectious diseases. Vaccination against Poliomyelitis: A great event of the year was the introduction of poliomyelitis vaccination, when in May for the first time, we had in our hands a successful defence weapon to prevent the occurrence of this infection. Although supplies were extremely limited, due to the complexity and cost of manufacture on a commercial scale, such stocks as were available were administered to previously registered applicants. Vaccination against Smallpox: This is a voluntary procedure but it is most important because of the constant risk of Smallpox breaking out due to the possible entrance into the country by air or other means of persons who may be incubating the disease, which may not immediately be recognised, and will undoubtedly pass on unknown to other susceptible persons. They in turn if not immediately diagnosed may extend the outbreak which has to be confined by the vaccination or re.vaccination of all contacts and strict isolation of all cases with thorough and effective current and terminal disinfection. Calculations show that by the end of 1956 some 66/0 of children born between 1st July 1955 and 30th June 1956 have been vaccinated. Births: The number of live births for 1956 is 761 and compares with 760 for 1955. The birth rate is 12.15 per 1,000 of the population. Deaths: The number of deaths recorded in 1956 is 615 compared with 600 for 1955. This gives a death rate of 9.82 per 1,000 of the population. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1956 is 12 giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 15.76 compared with a Rate of 22.36 for 1955. Causes of Death: The main causes of death during 1956 were:. Heart 196 Cancer 12k Vascular lesions of Nervous System 77 National attention has been drawn in recent years to the general increase in the number of deaths attributable to lung cancer and its connexion with cigarette smoking. The following table shows the relevant figures for the past five years in respect of Surbiton residents. The Registrar. General couples cancer of the lung with cancer of the bronchus in his abbreviated list of causes of death.

Care of the Aged: Much good work is being done by voluntary bodies in caring for the aged. ageing is inevitable but the object is to postpone the physical and mental deterioration which may accompany it. The closer working together of all the workers whether voluntary or professional . or County Authority, Regional Hospital Board or Borough is needed and sought after here. Every effort is made by the Department to get to know of aged persons in need of special care and to bring it to them. Housing: During 1956 the Corporation completed 8 housing units; built by private development 22k; by other Local Authorities 51, and self.contained flats provided by conversion (private enterprise) 13. Staff: Details of the staff and changes during the year are to be found on page one. I welcome the appointment of Dr.W.H.Kinstrie as Deputy Medical Officer of Health to the Borough. This is a part.time appointment una is a valuable help in respect of deputising, assistance and medical examination of Corporation staff and workpeople. I would now record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for encouragement in the work of the Public Health Department, and to Mr Eldridge, the Public Health Inspectors, to Mr Elms and the staff of the Department for rallying to the new Medical Officer of Health and for their hard work throughout the year. I have the honour to be Mr Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. W. STARKEY, Medical Officer of Health. . 5 .

There was only one case of Poliomyelitis notified in the Borough during 1956 - a boy of 7, who developed the non-paralytic type in an obscure way. The illness was not severe and he made a complete recovery. He had not "been vaccinated against poliomyelitis. During the year a national scheme came into operation whereby parents could register their children for vaccination against Paralytic Poliomyelitis. It was sponsored by the Ministry of Health and the Medical Research Council, and on behalf of the Surrey County Council ana the County Medical Officer the Divisional Medical Officer conducted the operation in the North Central Division (Kingston, Maiden, Esher and Surbiton) in a field of approximately 23,000 children in the appropriate age groups. In 1956 a limited amount of vaccine was available and, therefore, only a proportion of those who were registered were able to be vaccinated. The choice of children was made by the Medical Research Council according to the amount of vaccine available for use in May and June. The selection was made according to month, year and sex, so that the most representative selection of children could receive the limited supply of vaccine. The children concerned who were offered this batch of vaccine were those born between 1947 and 1954 (inclusive) (i.e.3 years to 9 years of age). In order to qualify for selection the names of children had to be registered with' the Divisional Medical Officer. A very successful registration of children was obtained. Figures for Surbiton are not separately available but included in the North Central Division a total of 7.104 (3,674 males and 3,430 females) up to and including 10th April, 1956, relating to children born between 1st January, 1947? to 31st December, 1954. The injection is 1 cc. of fluid intp the muscle of the left upper arm, repeated at the end of 3 - 4 weeks (i.e. 2 in all). Complete study of the results of all vaccinations was undertaken "by the Medical Research Council to which all records had to he sent, and the Ministry of Health had also to he informed of all notified cases of Poliomyelitis occurring during the year. Prom the study of the information a proper evaluation of the benefits of the vaccine as used in this country would be obtained. The vaccine selected was that used ON a small scale privately in 1955 with good results and Was modified. Salk Type, like that in U.S.A. and Canada. Before release it had to pass safety tests more stringent than those elsewhere. Appended below is a summary showing the number of children who received injections against Poliomyelitis during May and June of this year Girls: Boys; Total: Surbiton 98 116 214 Division 322 358 630 In addition to the above figures nine Surbiton children received one injection only. - 15 - It is considered that this vaccination scheme will confer a great benefit on our child population, and it is hoped that before many years a degree of success against poliomyelitis may be obtained somewhat similar to that against diphtheria in the past. On the 30th November, 1956, an afternoon meeting was held at the Civil Defence Headquarters, King Charles' Crescent, in the presence of His Worship the Mayor, the Mayoress, and Town Clerk, when the latest coloured film entitled "Defence against poliomyelitis" was shown to a specially invited audience of Councillors, General Medical Practitioners, Hospital and Public Health Authority medical staff, Health Visitors, District Nurses and Public Health Inspectors. About 130 persons attended and it was most encouraging that a large attendance gathered for this meeting which formed part of the programme of Education in Health, and of the general policy to promote co-ordination between workers in the field of preventive medicine. Prom reports received the meeting was greatly appreciated. DIPHTHERIA No cases of this disease have occurred in the Borough since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation service offered there is no reason why the disease should not be entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rests with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who is also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organises the service within the Borough. Clerical work is conducted in the Public Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35% of a clerk's salary is reimbursed. A campaign was conducted during April in an endeavour to increase the number of children immunised. With the co-operation of the Chief and. Senior Officers of the Town Council, posters were exhibited and leaflets distributed to the public drawing attention to the services available. Arrangements were made with the Managers of the cinemas in the Borough for two slides to be shown during the week commencing the 9th April for six days. A personal appeal was made by letter to the general medical practitioners in the Borough to assist a special effort during 1956 to secure the highest Possible percentage of immunity to diphtheria amongst the children in Surbiton. Arrangements have been made with general practitioners to carry out diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisations carried out in the course of his general medical service; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed record received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from the Central public Health Laboratory at Colindale. - 16 - Formerly the use of Diphtheria Prophylactic alone was the practice, Whooping Cough Prophylactic being administered separately. Then the two materials were combined and so used in suitable cases, whilst during 1956 Tetanus antigen was added to make a triple substance. With Triple antigen, prophylaxis against diphtheria, whooping, cough and tetanus can be given in the first few months of life. This, together with the later booster doses should give the child immunity for several years. It is administered by three doses of l c.c. at monthly intervals, beginning at the age of 3 to 4 months. Single booster doses may be given at 2 and 5 years. Only three injections are needed to complete immunisation which gives children the protection they need against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus rather than using separate antigens for each of these diseases. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at:- Gosbury Hill Clinic, Friday mornings 1, Gosbury Hill, at 11 o'clock. Hook. Telephone: Elmbridge 5737. South Place Clinic, Monday mornings Ewell Rood, at 11 o'clock. Surbiton. Telephone: Elmbridge 4897. (or Diphtheria Immunisation may also be carried out by patient's own doctor, as described above). DIPHTHRIA IMMUNISATION The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group.

Its seriousness is such that the simple precaution of vaccination ought not to be neglected even though it is no longer compulsory. Patients of all ages can he vaccinated by their own doctors, whilst children are also dealt with at the Clinics under the control of the Surrey County Council. Lymph is obtainable from the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. The number of persons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during 1956 was:- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 or over. TOTAL Vaccinations 518 14 16 10 45 603 j Re-vaccinations - 1 9 21 210 241 TYPHOID FEVER AND PARA-TYPHOID FEVER An interesting case of typhoid fever (Type D2 German) occurred in a child aged 11 months, resident in the Borough. The child was taken to Kingston Hospital and later transferred to Tolworth Hospital where she made a good recovery. On visiting the home it was found that the child's grandmother had been staying in this country with her daughter and son-in-law on a visit from Germany. Enquiries revealed that the mother had suffered from typhoid fever some years ago and that the grandmother had been a carrier for eight years. Laboratory tests showed the parents to be free from infection but confirmed the mother's previous illness. The.German Health Authorities confirmed the carrier state of the grandmother and attended to her, and there was no extension of the infection in the Borough. The case of Para-typhoid Fever was a child of 15 months who was on a visit to the Borough from another district where some cases of this disease were occurring, and there is little doubt that she was infected at home. - 19 - SONNE' DYSENTERY The occurrence of the highest number of cases yet recorded in Surbiton calls for comment. During the past ten years the type of Dysentery known as "Sonne" has become widely recognised in this country, but fortunately the illness is usually mild in character. The total number of cases notified in England and Vales in 1956 was 48,982. It is acce.pted that there is still much to be learnt about this disease and further study is called for. Unlike other forms of dysentery it seems to prefer cold, damp conditions. It is known to be highly infectious, spread taking place by personal contact with infected persons or articles as well as through the medium of food or drink. Personal hygiene is of the utmost importance in prevention especially the washing of hands after use of water-closet and before eating. W.C.'s should be kept scrupulously clean, seats, chain-pulls and door handles in particular being frequently washed. The disease was first recognised in Surbiton in 1950 when 140 cases were notified mainly in the Chessington and Hook districts; 1951 saw 62 cases but there was a complete lull in 1952. In 1953, 1954 and 1955 the figures were 10, 12 and 25 with a jump to 289 in 1956. Again the majority of the cases occurred at Chessington and Hook, but this time there was some spread into Tolworth with a few cases in the vicinity of Surbiton Hill. Schools are naturally associated with the dissemination of the illness, but without doubt it also spreads rapidly through households once introduced. It is therefore regarded as a "family" illness necessitating checking of all contacts. This is readily done in the laboratory by examination of faeces, but the task of controlling an outbreak is a major operation calling for close co-operation between laboratory, medical practitioners, teachers, parents and Public Health Department staff. The high local notification rate is no doubt due in large measure to the diligence with which cases are searched for and contacts checked. No person who has been a confirmed case (child or adult) is regarded as reasonably free from liability to spread infection until three consecutive negative specimens have been forthcoming. There is much evidence of reversion after two negatives and even of this occurring more than once with the same patient. There are those who, because of the general mildness of the illness and the difficulties of applying proper control measures, express a view that the disease may be ignored and allowed to run its course, the outbreak declining naturally. This policy is not accepted by us. Sonne Dysentery is a recognisable highly infectious notifiable disease which can be fatal in very young children and cause untold interference with life and work. It requires relentless application of ordinary public health measures to combat it and the close co-operation of all groups concerned. - 20 _ It is the intelligent application of epidemiological and other knowledge that must meet a quickly spreading outbreak when it occurs. The greatest chance of success comes when no time is lost in recognising the condition and notifying it to the Public Health Department. FOOD POISONING There were no outbreaks of food poisoning and no deaths from this cause. Thirteen sporadic cases or suspected cases were notified by general practitioners, in four ases the causative organism, was identified as S. Typhi-Murium, in one case Staph. Aureus, and in one S. Enteritidis. No bacteriological confirmation of the other seven notifications was forthcoming. laboratory FAciliTICS. Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health), and opportunity is taken to gratefully acknowledge the co-operation of Doctor D.M. Stone and her staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our specimens ore taken. Apart from samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other foods (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the Inspectors in the course of investigating cases of-dysentery, typhoid, food poisoning etc. and taken to the Laboratory: Year Faeces Suspected Food. 1950 1,202 13 1951 694 2 1952 133 15 1953 129 12 1954 263 8 1955 306 10 1956 3,704 6 EXCLUSION FROM SCHOOL Five hundred and eleven certificates were issued excluding and re-admitting school coses and contacts of infectious diseases. - 21 - TUBERCULOSIS At the end of the year 413 persons were shown to be suffering from tuberculosis and living within the district:- Sex Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Males 220 15 Females 148 30 Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS pulmonary Non-PuImonary pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F Under 1 1 - - - - - - - 1 - 4 2 1 1 - - - - - 5 - 14 2 - - 1 - - - - 15 - 24 7 14 - - - - - - 25 - 34 14 12 - 2 - 1 - - 35 - 44 7 3 1 - 1 1 - - 45 - 54 6 4 - 1 2 - - - 55 -64 5 1 - - 3 - - 1 65 and over 4 1 - - 4 - - - Totals 48 38 2 4 10 2 - 1 Of the 92 new cases tabulated above 38 were transferred from other districts.

It was not necessary to take any action under these regulations during the year. Public Health Act, 1936, Section 172 No action was taken under this Section. - 23 - MASS RADIOGRAPHY The Mass X-ray Unit visited the Borough twice during the year. On the first occasion it visited the Methodist Church, Moor Lane, Chessington, from 5th to 11th January, 1956, the result of the survey being as follows:- Male Female Total number examined 416 460 Pulmonary Tuberculosis Inactive 21 15 Non-tuberculous abnormalities 21 22 No definitely active cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were detected. As the survey was carried out in very had weather conditions the results obtained were encouraging though the numbers were small. The second survey was carried out at the Co-operative Hall, Broadway, Tolworth, from 19th to 27th November, 1956, the result being as under:- Male Female Total number examined 1,431 1,731 Pulmonary Tuberculosis Active 1 1 Pulmonary Tuberculosis Inactive 27 27 Non-tuberculous abnormalities 70 55 Cases not yet diagnosed 14 16 This was the first time the Unit had visited this part of the Borough, and the survey was planned as part of the Unit's policy to set up in new places. The attendance proved the visit very successful and well worth while. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year sixty-nine medical examinations were carried out in connection with staff entering the Council's Superannuation Fund or Sick Pay Scheme; as follows:- Superannuation Fund Sick Pay Scheme Specia1 Examination 34 34 1 - 24 - welfare of old people There is in the Borough much voluntary activity devoted to this cause. Seven Clubs meet weekly in various parts of the district and there is another which opens daily. a Chiropody service for which there is very great demand has been organised and five sessions per week are held. Seaside holidays for parties of elderly people ore arranged annually, and there is a distribution of dinners to the housebound at Christmas. Home visiting is carried out so far as the availability of visitors permits, and there is close co-operation with official bodies. All this work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life in the Borough and presided over by His Worship the Mayor. As is usual with such organisations its work is restricted by its income, which emanates entirely from donations and subscriptions from various sources including a Flag Day, and by lack of suitable premises. Whilst the problem of finance will be constant and is an accepted hazard of all voluntary social work, the accommodation difficulty is likely to be solved in the near future thanks to generous assistance from the Surbiton Borough Council which is helping the Committee to provide a house which will be used as an Old People's Centre including recreation rooms, club, chiropody clinic, canteen, office, etc. The Borough Council also makes a generous contribution towards the cost of the Meals on Wheels service which is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society. The number of mid-day meals distributed during the year was 3,266 towards which the recipients aid only l/3d. per meal. WATER SUPPLY The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises have a direct mains supply and there are no wells in use. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. Five bacteriological samples were taken by the Department for special reasons, and all were satisfactory. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The widening of the course of the Hogsmill River through the Borough is completed, but the state of the water is likely to remain unsatisfactory until the effluent from the Epsom Sewage Disposal Works is no longer discharged into it. A new sewer has been constructed which will soon carry sewage from Epsom to the joint disposal works being provided in Lower Marsh Lane. Meanwhile notice boards are still displayed warning against bathing and paddling in the Hogsmill River. - 25 - swimming baths Publicly owned bath. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition eighteen samples were taken, by the Public health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. Privately owned bath open to the Public The Ace of Spades swimming pool, Kingston By-Pass Road, was not in use during the year. School both. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine coupled with frequent changes of the water. Nine samples were taken by the Department to ensure adequate chlorination. PUBLIC CLEANSING Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The rate of collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 and 1948. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 260 (224 mechanical, 31 non-mechanical, and 5 works of building construction). Five hundred and twentyone visits were made to these premises, and- work was carried out to remedy contraventions found as under:- Particulars: No. of cases in which defects found and remedied. Insufficient sanitary conveniences 11 factories Defective, dirty or inad quately lighted sanitary conveniences. 39 factories. Other offences, etc. 13 factories Three certificates were issued under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factories to which they related were provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed therein as may be reasonably required in the circumstances. There were one hundred and twenty-one outworkers on the register at the end of the year. Ten visits were made but no infringements found. - 26 - FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 and 1948 (Contd). 1.

The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases (a) where new housing accommodation would "be provided "by the conversion of an existing building, (b) where additional accommodation was to "be provided by adding rooms, and (c) where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. Fourteen applications for grants were received during the year.- Nine' were recommended "by the Council and the remainder were disposed of as follows Rejected: Not proceeded with; 4 1 The amounts granted together with works approved are detailed below Serial Amount Granted Approved Works: No. £. s. d. 60 63. 18. 0.

Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a large variety of foods which were not so fit were surrendered by the owners and either salvaged for animal feeding or destroyed by burning. The total weight of such goods was:15 cwts: 2 qrs: 1 lb; 13¾; ozs. There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough consequently no meat inspection is carried out except in butchers' shops. Forty-six samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure to check on fitness for food. FOOD HYGIENE. Forty-one premises are registered under section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale, and nine premises for the preparation of preserved food intended for sale for human consumption (being the preparation of fish by any process of cooking). One thousand, two hundred and thirteen visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens,restaurants, public-houses, food handling businesses, and vehicles to ensure' the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene ana to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act; byelaws and other legislation:- Hot water supply provided 15 Protection of food from contamination 7 Windows repaired or renewed 2 Floors repaired or renewed 2 Food premises and other rooms cleansed 92 WCs cleansed or repaired 16 Drains cleansed,repaired or renewed 1 WCs lighted or ventilated 7 Cold stores provided 1 Store ceiling repaired 3 Accumulations removed 2 Dustbins provided 2 Refuse storage improved 2 Sinks and basins provided 6 Waste pipes repaired or renewed 8 Miscellaneous 6 In general the standard of food hygiene throughout the Borough has been maintained at a satisfactory level, though it is a subject which requires constant attention by the Inspectors. 37 FOOD HYGIENE (Cont.) On 1st January, 1956, the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, and The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, came into operation. The Act is partly a consolidating measure which repeals the Acts of 1938, 1950 and 1954, as well as certain other Acts and Orders. At the same time important changes in the law have been effected. Perhaps the most important change is the replacement of Section 13 of the 1938 Act (which dealt with precautions against contamination of food) with powers enabling the Ministers to make regulations as to hygiene in connection with the sale etc. of food to the public. The long-awaited Regulations appeared simultaneously with the new Act and prescribe detailed requirements in respect of (i) cleanliness of food premises, stalls, etc., and of apparatus and equipment, (ii) the hygienic handling and wrapping of food, (iii) the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and the action to be taken where they suffer from, or are carriers of, certain infections, (iv) the construction, repair and maintenance of food premises, stalls, vehicles, etc., and the facilities to be provided, and (v) the temperature at which certain foods that are particularly liable to transmit disease are to be kept. Higher maximum penalties than formerly are provided for, whilst in certain circumstances a person may be disqualified from using catering premises for a period. Some of the Regulations which require alterations to premises or substantial changes in existing practices did not come into operation for six months. Local Authorities are empowered to give certificates of exemption from certain Regulations if through restricted accommodation or special circumstances compliance cannot reasonably be required. "Food premises" means any premises on or from which there is carried on any food business. Some doubts which existed previously as to whether certain types of premises could be dealt with are removed by the definition of "business" which includes the undertaking of a canteen, club, school, hospital or institution, whether carried on for profit or not, and any undertaking or activity carried on by a public or local authority. The Minister of Health states that- "food hygiene is recognised in the food and catering industries as sound commercial practice serving their own business interests as well as the public health, and,the Minister is confident that local authorities will find that in applying these Regulations they have the support of the food and catering industries. Statutory regulations by themselves can never achieve the reduction in food-borne disease that everyone hopes to see. The application of the Regulations will need continual supplementing with publicity and education in order that food handlers and the public may always have before them the importance of good food hygiene practice". Nothing spectacular has occurred in the Borough consequent 38 FOOD HYGIENE (Cont.) upon this new legislation. The general standard of food hygiene had reached a satisfactory level as a result of constant pressure under earlier powers, and the work went steadily on. Generally speaking the traders in the district have co-operated well with the Council for many years in efforts to "bring the food shops up to a good standard, and the results are there for all to see. One of the yet unsolved problems is that of van sales and deliveries of "open" foods such as bread, fish, fruit and meat which are not always carried out with the attention to good hygienic practice which is being sought. There is not the slightest doubt that the final rounds in this contest will he settled by public opinion. Legislation has its limitations, but once the public decides that it will no longer tolerate some of the less desirable habits of bygone days which are dying all too slowly the matter will be quickly cleared up.

The Analyst's reports and details of action taken on contravening samples were as follows:— 1711 (informal) Sausage - pork Contained only 51% meat instead of a minimum of 65%. Warning letter sent. 1712 (informal) Sausages, Chipolata pork. It was a sample of preserved pork sausages containing 290 p.p.m. of sulphur dioxide. It was subsequently found that the label attached to these sausages had been inadvertentlydamaged. 1721 (informal) Cake Mix, Chocolate Labelling liable to mislead and ingredients not specified in a conspicuous and prominent position. Manufacturers informed that Committee considered label misleading and they agreed to slightly amend wording. 1723 (informal) Iron & Yeast Tablets. 85% deficient in ascorbic acid (vitamin C) compared with the statement on the label. Formal sample taken (No. 1741)• 1726 (informal) Steak and Kidney Pudding The article contained no kidney. Formal sample taken which was genuine. 1728 (informal) Cake mix This article contained the ingredients foi making the basic cake, with the addition of one egg, but no ingredients for icing or filling, whereas the carton in which the article was sold bore a large picture on the front panel of a cake complete with icing and filling. Correspondence ensued and manufacturers interviewed but no satisfactory conclusion reached. 1729 (informal) Cake mix This article contained the ingredients for making the basic cake, but contained no ingredients for icing or filling, whereas the carton in which the article was sold bore on the front panel a large picture of a cake complete with icing and filling. Matter taken up with manufacturers who introduced a new package which though an improvement on the original was felt to be not entirely satisfactory. 4l FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.J 1732 (informal) Cake mix This article contained the ingredients for making the basic cake, hut contained no ingredients for icing or filling, whereas the carton in which the article was sold bore on the front panel a large picture of a cake complete with icing and filling. Manufacturers agreed to amend the wording on their cartons in a satisfactory way when next hatch printed. 1735 (informal) Cake mix This article contained the ingredients for making the basic cake, hut contained no ingredients for icing or filling, whereas the carton in which the article was sold bore on the front panel a large picture of a cake complete with icing and filling. The manufacturing company was found to be no longer in operation and the article not being made. The new company noted the comments and would pay due regard to them if they proceeded to manufacture and market. 1736 (informal) Cake mix This article contained the ingredients for making the basic cake, hut contained no ingredients for icing or filling, whereas the carton in which the article was sold hore 011 the front panel a large picture of a cake complete with icing and filling. The manufacturers had already brought into use a new carton with satisfactory wording. 17M (formal) Iron and Yeast Tablets - vitamin Contained only 8 mg. on average of vitamin C per tablet instead of the equivalent of 12.5 mg. as declared, a deficiency of 36%. Manufacturers withdrew remaining stock and replaced with tablets made by a new process which it was believed would remain in satisfactory condition for reasonable periods of storage. 42 FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) 1777 (informal) Bread and butter ' Consisted of bread spread with p mixture of butter and margarine, the proportion of butter in the mixture being not more than 60%. Cafe proprietor warned. He undertook to use butter only in future. 1774 (informal) Bronchial mixture Contained only 0.85% v/v of chloroform instead of the 2.5% declared on the label. Warning given. Manufacturers agreed that there should not have been so great a loss in chloroform content. They were taking active steps to ensure that both at time of manufacture and packing chloroform is adequately dispersed and present in full strength. 1775 (informal) Condensed milk Discoloured and thickened due to ageing effect. Not unfit for consumption, but unfit for sale. Dealer informed. There was one prosecution for selling to the prejudice of the purchaser a loaf of bread which was not of the substance demanded in that it contained insect webbing etc. A fine of £20. was imposed and the Council awarded £7.15.0. costs. A local butcher was given a warning after due consideration by the Public Health Committee for selling minced meat containing a piece of bandage. MILK SUPPLY. (i) At the end of the year there were thirty-eight entries on the register as follows:— Distributors of milk with premises in the Borough 21 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 8 43 MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) (ii) MilkfSpecial Designation] (Raw Milk) Regulations, 19U9-1954. MilklSpecial Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949-1953. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows:- Pasteurised milk 19 " " (supplementary) 9 Tuberculin Tested milk 17 „ „ „ (supplementary) 8 Sterilised Milk 17 " " (supplementary) 8 (iii) Eighty-five samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests:— Turbidity Test T. B. Biological Test Methylene Blue Test Phosphatase Test Pasteurised - 45 45 T.T. Pasteurised - - 13 13 Sterilised 3 - - - T.T. Raw Milk - 6 - - T.T.(Farm Bottled) - - 1 - T.T. (C.I.Farm Bottled - 6 - - |Raw Milk (ungraded) - 11 - - The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test is for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. All samples conformed to the required standard. Proceedings were taken against a Distributor under Section 26 (l) of the Milk & Dairies Regulations, 1949, for failing to ensure that a vessel (bottle) used for containing milk was in a state of thorough cleanliness. A fine of £30. was imposed and the Council awarded £l0.10.0d. costs. 44 ICE CREAM. Premises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 1 6, Pood & Drugs Act, 1955? as under:- For manufacture, storage and sale 8 For manufacture, storage and sale hut manufacture to he limited to iced lollies 13 For storage and sale hut not manufa c tur e 136 During the year 16 applications for registration were received (including 8 changes of occupier) and were approved. 54 samples were taken, details being as follows:- Ice Cream. Grade 1 49 90.7% 92.6% Grade 2 1 Grade 3 2 7.4% Grade 4 Nil 52 Iced Lollies Grade 1 2 54 The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six-monthly period, 50 per cent of a vendor's samples should fall into Grade 1, 80 per cent into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20 per cent into Grade 3, and none into Grade 4. The results shewn above indicate that the satisfactory standard referred to in the last two reports is being maintained. No ice cream is now manufactured within the Borough, but a few retailers make their own iced lollies. 45 DUSTBINS. Sixty-one dustbins were provided as a result of 6 statutory and 55 informal notices served. The Council's scheme for the sale of new dustbins was continued, fifty bins being sold during the year. The ambiguity of the Public Health Act which provides that the local authority may require either the owner or occupier of any building to provide a dustbin still gives rise to difficulties necessitating a judicial decision by the Council in all disputed cases. None of the six cases so decided by the Council was the subject of appeal to the Magistrates. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Forty-four licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. Twenty-four of the caravans are standing on the Riverhill Estate which has been leased to a local Sports Club. The remainder are stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. There is one site on which some unlicensed caravans are parked which is to be dealt with by the Council acquiring the land with a view to development. DISINFECTION. (a) During the year disinfection was carried out at forty-two premises in which the following diseases occurred:- Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 7 Typhoid 1 Tuberculosis 16 Scarlet fever 4 Meningococcal infection 1 Scabies 1 Chicken-pox 1 Encephalitis (suspected) 1 Measles 1 Phemphigus 1 Miscellaneous 8 Disinfection was also carried out at thirty premises on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. 46 DISINFECTION (Cont). ("b) The total number of articles disinfected "by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was:— Disinfected Destroyed Blankets 36 1 Bolsters 2 4 Featherbeds 2 5 Mattresses 14 5 Mattress covers 2 1 Pillows 34 9 Pillow cases 13 — Sheets 9 — Towels 6 — Wearing apparel 21 — Rugs 4 1 Counterpanes 7 3 Cushions 6 — Miscellaneous 26 — 182 29 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 82 No. of library books disinfected 91 DISII-TFBSTATION. (a) Bed Bugs Council Houses Other Houses Found to be infested Disinfested Found to be infested Disinfested 1 1 6 6 Methods employed for disinfestation:— Spraying with insecticide 7 (b) School Canteens. At the request of the County Council nine school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. (c) General. Advice is frequently sought from the Department in the identification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a small stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to "be very much appreciated. 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. One burial was effected in accordance with Section 50 of the Act where it appeared that no suitable Arrangements for the disposal of the "body were "being made otherwise than by the Council. It was not necessary to make use of the powers of Section 47 for compulsory removal to suitable premises of sick or aged persons in need of care and attention. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 75 bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Grant-aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial properties and the full cost of the work has therefore to be recovered from the occupiers of such premises or, in certain circumstances, the owners. 40 busir;ess or industrial premises, schools, etc. were treated by the .Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. Whilst it is the duty of occupiers of houses to keep their premises free from rats and mice, the Council continued to assist occupiers of private dwellings to carry out treatment without charge. This decision has considerably facilitated the work at private houses as treatment is able to proceed almost immediately an infestation is found. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during' the year. It seems that the rodent population is being kept down to as low a level as is likely to be achieved until new techniques are evolved and perhaps new poisons introduced. 48 49 1. VISITS.

One hundred and ninety-two visits were made in the administration of this Act, and seven infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purposes of this Act is a very comprehensive term and includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the end of 1956, was:— Antique dealers and secondhand furniture 6 Bakers 16 Bpots- and shoes 34 Builders and Decorators supplies 19 Butchers 37 Cafes and restaurants 40 Chemists 23 Confectioners, newsagents and tobacconists 93 Cycles, radio and television 16 Dairies 8 Drapers and ladies' outfitters 49 Electrical supplies 7 Fishmongers and fried fish shops 16 General stores 11 Greengrocers, fruiterers and florists 50 Grocers and provision merchants 73 Hairdressers 42 Hardware, ironmongery and timber 20 Licensed premises 53 Motor and cycle dealers and engineers 29 Tailors and outfitters 18 Upholsterers and house-furnishers 15 Watchmakers and jewellers 8 Miscellaneous 57 Total:- 745 THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT,1952. This Act which prohibits the sale or letting of certain heating appliances without an effective fireguard, together with Regulations made by the Secretary of State, became operative during 1954. Seventeen visits were made to premises in the Borough and two warnings were given where such appliances were not satisfactory. The offending appliances v/ere withdrawn from sale. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Six premises were licensed during the year. Twenty-three inspections were made but no infringements of the licence conditions found. 52 AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT,1956. This Act came into force on 5th July, 1956, and aims at securing the safety, health and welfare of persons employed in agriculture and certain similar occupations, and the avoidance of accidents to children in connection with the use of agricultural vehicles, machinery and implements. Most of the provisions of the Act are to be administered by officers to be appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but the Town Council can require the provision of suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences for employees and the proper maintenance end cleaning thereof. It is remarkable that requirements for the provision of proper washing facilities for employees are not also within the sphere of the Council but are to be dealt with by the Minister's staff. The Council's Public Health Officers were duly appointed authorised officers for the purposes of the Act. CIVIL DEFENCE. The- Public Health Department, in common with other departments of local government, makes its contribution to the organisation, training and practice of Civil Defence as required in time of war. The inroads thus made into the time and energy of those principally concerned are considerable, whilst the work of the clerical staff which is already barely adequate in numbers is increased. The Medical Officer of Health has been appointed Head of the Ambulance Section and shares the services of the Civil Defence Officer as administrative assistant as a condition of acceptance of the appointment. Much good work in recruiting and training has been accomplished and continues. The Chief Public Health Inspector is Head of the Welfare Section of the local Unit, and this Section has developed Tinder his command into an active and essential part of the organisation which functions in exercises and would be available at times of civil disaster as well as for the primary task for which embodied. 53
