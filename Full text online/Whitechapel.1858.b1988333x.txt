55 WHI 6 BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. REPORT on The Sanitary Condition of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, for the THREE MONTHS ENDING APRIL 3rd, 1858. Read to the Board, May 10th, 1858. LONDON: PRINTED BY T. PENNY, 121, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, and 9, london terrace, hackney road. 1858. REPORT. Gentlemen, On comparing the mortality of the Whitechapel District for the Quarter ending April 3rd, 1858, with the mortality for the corresponding quarter of last year, it will be observed that there is an increase of 17 ; the mortality for the former period being 686, including 77 non-residents, whose deaths took place in the London Hospital, and for the latter, 669, including 68 non-residents who died in the same institution. A slight addition must be made to these numbers for parishioners dying in other charitable institutions in London. After deducting the deaths of non-residents in both instances, the increase of the mortality for the quarter just ended is 8, which may be accounted for by a probable increase of the population. The increase of mortality is shown principally in the diseases of the respiratory organs, and especially is it so, in the deaths of children under 5 years of age ; the total deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia, during the last quarter, being 154, of which 76 occurred to children under 5 years of age ; whereas, for the corresponding quarter of last year, the deaths from these two diseases, were 109, including 67 children under 5 years of age. The total number of deaths of young children under 5 years, for the quarter, is 289; and, on referring to the table showing the causes of death, it will be seen, that the greatest number are caused by Convulsions, Measles, Hooping Cough, Mesenteric Disease, Water ,on the Brain and Pneumonia. This large mortality among young children, caused by the above-named diseases, shows, that two powerful agents, insalubrity of the atmosphere and poverty, are in operation in this district; the former, as manifested by the fatality of zymotic and tubercular diseases ; and the latter, by the deaths from inflammatory affections of the respiratory organs; the constitutions of the children of the poor, from the want of proper clothing and fuel, and from insufficiency of food, being unable to resist the action of cold. The exposure in the streets of infants imperfectly clad, is a fertile source of disease and death, among all classes so exposed ; but especially so among the poor. There is a diminution of 9 in the total number of deaths from epidemic diseases, (108 against 117.) In fever, formerly the great scourge in the Whitechapel District there is a diminution of 10, (32 against 42;) while there is an increase in the deaths 4 from Hooping Cough and Diarrhoea. Two cases of death from Diptheria are recorded, one, in the Mile End New Town District, and the other, in the Spitalfields. This disease prevailed extensively on the Continent during last Autumn, and was exceedingly fatal. It is called "Diptheria," from a Greek word signifying membrane, a false membrane being formed at the upper and back part of the throat, impeding deglutition and respiration. It appears, from the last Quarterly Report of the Registrar General, that, according to the popular theory in France, this disease is occasioned by the diffusion of putrid effluvia over the fauces. Diptheria may be confounded with Laryngitis, Croup, Searlatina, Quinsey, &c., but with care, a correct diagnosis may be formed. Small Pox proved fatal in one instance, (male, aged 13.) Whether the patient was vaccinated or not, is not stated. Twenty cases of death were uncertified by any Medical Practitioner, 9 of which occurred in the Spitalfields Registration District; two of these were cases of Bronchitis (a male aged 41, and a female aged 64), one was a case of fever, (male aged 60), the other 5 cases were registered as Convulsions of Infants. The remaining uncertified cases of death, which occurred in the other districts, were, with the exception of two, (a case of Consumption, aged 24, and a case of Malformation of the Mouth, aged 17 days), were all cases of Convulsions of Infants. The attention of the local registrars cannot be too forcibly directed to all cases of death, when uncertified by a Medical Practitioner. Forty-eight inquests were held on persons dying within the district during the last quarter. The deaths in four of these instances are recorded as being caused by Privation and Cold ; one death was occasioned by Suffocation, or "Asphixia but "whether natural or from intoxication, the evidence was inconclusive." Eleven cases of deaths from burns and scalds are recorded, 8 of which, were from the clothes of parties catching fire. A case of death of a child, 4½ years, from a scald of the Glottis is registered, but as an inquest was not held in this case,' there is not a record made as to the mode in which the injury was caused. It may possibly have arisen from the child drinking hot tea from a tea-pot. The deaths, excluding the non-residents, are 609, and the births 744 ; the excess of births over deaths for the last quarter are, therefore, 135, whereas, for the corresponding quarter of last year, the excess of births over deaths was only 116. The greatest number of deaths was registered in the third week of March, when it amounted to 85, and the smallest number was registered in the first week of January, when it was only 36 ; the average number per week, for the entire quarter, was 52.8. If the inquests were always registered, as they might, and ought to be, in the same week in which they are held, the variations in the number of deaths per week, would not be so great, and the public would not be startled by the 5 announcement of such a high rate of mortality, as is occasionally the case under the present arrangements. If the constable would give notice to the local registrars, that the coroner was about holding an inquest in his district, this inconvenience would be obviated, for I have no doubt that the registrar would readily attend the inquest. The number of cases of illness recorded by the Medical Officers of the Union, are 3009, which is 318 in excess of the corresponding quarter of last year ; but it is gratifying to me to be able to report, that the fever cases have materially decreased, they being 185 against 327. The difference in the amount of sickness is occasioned principally by the greater prevalence of diseases of the respiratory organs, 819 against G86. From the records of sickness which are now published weekly, it appears that an average of 781 new cases have received gratuitous advice in this district every week ; 231 of which were attended by the Medical Officers of the Union, exclusive of those which were treated in the Workhouses, averaging a total of 33 per week. The Eastern Dispensary, and the London Dispensary, each, average weekly, about 40 cases ; while the London Hospital supplies medical advice and medicines to about 437 every week. These Institutions do not confine their usefulness to this district, but persons living at considerable distances avail themselves of the benefits they afford. I take this opportunity of tendering my thanks to Mr. CLOUGH, and Mr. Gayton, the resident Medical Officers of the Eastern, and London Dispensaries, and to Mr. Champneys, and Mr. Richardson, the Medical Officers of the Workhouses, for forwarding to me, weekly, the cases of sickness, which are recorded in their books. Two hundred and eighty-three houses have been systematically visited by your Inspectors during the last quarter, making a total of 3010, or more than a third of the entire district, since the commencement of their duties; and the particulars regarding the sanitary requirements are registered in books kept for that purpose, and which may be seen at any time, on application at my office. It appears from the returns furnished to me by the Inspectors, that 1362 cesspools have been abolished, and 20 overcrowded houses have been remedied ; but, for the further particular improvements which have been effected, I must refer you to the Tables Nos. 1, 2, and 15. The importance of visiting, in rotation, every house in the district, is shown by the bringing of nuisances under the notice of your Inspectors, which otherwise would have escaped observation. For instance, on visiting the houses in Duke Street, we discovered that one of the houses was used as a common lodging-house, but was not registered as such. This house was three stories high, and each room was overcrowded with lodgers. The staircase was dark, ill ventilated, and had a very offensive smell; the rooms were dirty and dilapidated, and such were the filthy habits of the people who occupied the attic, that urine and excrement were thrown into the rain 6 water pipe, which passed in front of the house and emptied itself on the pavement below. This case was reported to the Police, and the house is now duly registered, and placed under their surveillance. Again, rooms have been discovered which were used for infant schools, where the children were so closely packed together as to afford, in some instances, 25 cubic feet of space only for each child. Animals have also been found to be so kept, as to be a nuisance. As landlords are now aware that their property will be visited in rotation by the Inspectors, the necessary alterations and improvements are frequently effected by them, in anticipation of such visit, and orders are not required to be given. The cases of overcrowding in the houses of the poor, are perhaps the most difficult to deal with ; for, were a high standard to be taken as the minimum of space which should be allowed to each person inhabiting a single room; a very large number of additional lodging-houses would be required to afford shelter to the labouring class, and the rents would necessarily be raised to an amount above their means of payment. On the other hand, if people are allowed to live together in very confined spaces, not only will their own health suffer, but the health of the community at large be endangered. It appears that about 800 or 900 cubic feet are allowed to each prisoner in our jails, with every means adopted to renew the air frequently; but, in many of the abodes of the poor in your district, less than one quarter of that space is all that is allotted to each inmate ; and, in many instances, without any provision being made for the renewal of the air, the doors being locked and the windows kept shut during the day. As overcrowding is now almost universally considered to be one of the chief causes of ill health, I would advise that 300 cubic feet be the minimum amount of space for each inhabitant of a room, which should be sanctioned by your Board, and every house, in which such a space is not afforded to each tenant, should be considered as overcrowded. Several houses where fever cases existed, have been inspected by myself and your Inspectors, and great improvements have been made in many of them, particularly in John Street, Heneage Street. Here, fever prevailed very extensively, and was in several instances fatal ; but, as the whole of the 59 houses in this locality have been thoroughly drained, lime-whited, and cleansed, I hope there will be no recurrence of this disease. A great improvement has been effected in Baker's Arms Alley, Rosemary Lane, formerly, one of the dirtiest and most unhealthy localities in this district. Two of the houses have been taken down, and the site on which they stood, now forms yards for the houses in Rosemary Lane. About 150 pigs have been removed from this locality, and the yards and sheds in which the animals were kept have been converted to other purposes. 7 The keeping of pigs, on the North- side of the district, is of frequent occurrence; numerous complaints are made of the nuisance, and several summonses have been taken out, and a conviction in every case has been obtained. Complaints are still made against several trades-nuisances ; particularly of the smoke, and of the re-burning of animal charcoal by some of the sugar refiners; also, of the roasting of malt, bone boiling, &c., and of the keeping of cows. All these nuisances can be greatly mitigated if ordinary care be taken by the proprietors. For the proper regulation of cow-houses, the following rules should be observed : and I would suggest, that a copy of them be sent to each cow-keeper in the district, with a direction to attach it to a conspicuous part of the premises. REGULATIONS FOR COW-HOUSES. 1.—Every cow-house shall be paved with flag-paving or other non-absorbent material, set and bedded in cement, with a proper inclination to the foot of the stalls, so as to drain into a channel leading by a fall of not less than 1½ inches in 10 feet to a trapped gulley. 2.—Every cow-house shall be provided with a proper trapped drain to convey fluid matter alone into the sewers. 3.—Every cow-house shall be furnished with an adequate supply of water, and be washed thoroughly at least once a day. 4.—All solid manure and refuse shall be carted away every morning. 5.—Every cow-house shall be lime-whited at least four times a year, and shall be properly lighted and ventilated; and when the state of the neighbourhood requires it, shall be provided with a tight roof and ventilating shaft, so as to convey the noxious exhalations above the level of the adjacent houses. 6.—The grain-bins and receptacles for wash shall be kept properly cleansed and under cover. 7.—No underground cellar, and no part of a dwelliug-house, shall be used as cow-sheds. These regulations, with an additional one, setting forth the number of cubic feet of space which should be given to each cow, have been approved of by the London Cow-keeper's Association, and have been adopted by some of the Metropolitan Boards of Works. Should they meet with your approval, you will perhaps give orders to have them printed and circulated among the cow-keepers in your district. In the year 1850, the Committee of the Whitechapel Association "for promoting habits tending to the cleanliness, health, and comfort of the industrious classes," published a code of regulations for the preservation of health, and a copy of it was left at almost all the houses of the poor in the parish. As the issuing of this paper was attended with very beneficial results, I shall be happy, if it meet with 8 your approval, to prepare a few rules ; the observing of which will no doubt tend to promote the health and comfort of those for whom such instruction is intended. It gives me much pleasure in being able to state, that out of the 479 complaints entered in the complaint book during the last quarter, only ten summonses have been taken out against landlords for neglecting, or refusing to comply with, the orders of your Inspectors. It is frequently found that the friendly suggestions of the Medical Officer of Health, following upon the first or second notice of the Inspectors, has more effect, and a greater amount of work is done by such means, than by applying to the Magistrates for compulsory powers. The Whitechapel District, which formerly, by its mortuary returns, was shown to be the most unhealthy locality in London, has rate of mortality at the present time, very little above that of the entire metropolis, which for the year 1857, was 2.2 per cent, or 22 in 1000, the rate of mortality for the Whitechapel District being 2.4 per cent, or 24 in 1000. This is not the only gratifying result to those who are interested in the progress of sanitary improvement in this large and important manufacturing district; but the fever cases among the poor have also materially diminished, the average number of these cases per week attended by the Medical Officers of the Union for the last quarter, was 15, whereas for the corresponding period of last year, the average number was 25. Some of the most prominent causes of ill health in Towns and Cities, are now thoroughly understood by the community at large; such as the breathing of impure air, more especially when the impurity arises from overcrowding, and from animal refuse ; and public attention is consequently energetically given to remove such obvious sources of ill health. These well-directed efforts will verily have their reward in diminishing the amount of sickness, in refining the taste, improving the moral condition of the people, and engendering habits of self-respect among a class of persons, hitherto much neglected ; but the science of Preventive Medicine is now making rapid strides, is beginning to be taught in the numerous Schools of Medicine ; and it will be found, as this science advances, that there are many more causes in operation among a community, producing ill health and premature death, over which we have controul, than those which I have just enumerated. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, 15, Great Alie Street. JOHN LIDDLE. 1st Mat, 1858 APPENDIX TABLE I.

The fee required for the Registration of a birth after six weeks has elapsed, deters poor people from performing this necessary duty.

BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. ANNUAL REPORT on THE ^anitarg ©ontotton OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 2nd, lM Read to the Board, February 21st, 1858. PRINTED Bf T. PENNY, 121. LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, AND 9, LONDON TERRACE, HACKNEY ROAD. 1858. 5"B> 5® ?g> jT\ f&> m> m W W 4KS, o Gentlemen, In accordance with the proposal I formerly submitted to you of making my Quarterly Report for the last three months of the year an Annual Report, I have now the honor of laying before you an account of the mortality of the district, together with the progress of sanitary improvement, for the year ending 2nd January, 1858, a period embracing 53 weeks. I have chosen the present time for presenting you with an annual report, because it is coincident with that adopted by the Registrar General for publishing his Annual Abstract of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, which is the text book for the comparison of the mortality of each district, and my doing so, will afford facilities of any person feeling an interest in the subject, to observe annually the results of sanitary improvement, as shown in the rate of mortality in his own locality, and compare it with that in others. From the published returns of the Registrar General, the mortality in the Whitechapel district for the 10 years, 1841-to-50, is represented as being 29 in every 1000 living, or 1 in 34 of the whole population. In my first Annual Report for 1856, I estimated the mortality for the preceding year (1855) at 27 in every 1000, or 1 in 36 of the entire population, and during the last year, embracing 53 weeks, the death-rate is calculated to be 24'4 in 1000, or 1 in 41 of all living. The deathrate for this district has always been represented as higher than it really is, inasmuch as, the deaths of the non-residents have always been included in the returns. It nevertheless is considerably in excess of what it ought to be, and what I sincerely trust it will be in the course of a few years ; for, if we compare the mortality of this district with that of sixty-four* others in England, we shall find, that in the Whitechapel district, the deaths exceed those of the more healthy ones, by 8 or 9 in every 1000, or, in other words, that in your district, during the year 1856, (supposing the population to be as I have estimated it, viz : 84,000,) between 700 and 800 persons died unnecessarily and prematurely, the result being the same as if they had died violent deaths, occasioned either by accident or design. The death-rate for all * In sixty-four districts in England, the mortality was 15 and 17 in a 1000 living, and if the laws of health were better understood and practised, it is more than probable that even this now considered a low rate of mortality, would be still further reduced. 4 England in tlie year 1855, was 22 in a 1000 living, or 1 in 45 of the whole population. The rate of mortality, therefore, in your district, is 2.4 in 1000 above that of the whole of England, and on comparing the mortality in Whitechapel with the mortality of all England, 201 persons have died in excess in your district during the last year. It is, perhaps, almost impossible to estimate correctly the number of inhabitants in any large district, unless by actual enumeration ; but if the same annual progress has been continued, viz.—1*1 per cent, since the last census in 1851, as occurred from 1841 to 1851, the actual number of persons now residing in the Whitechapel district, would be nearly 86,000, but as several houses have been taken down within the last few years, and the registered lodging-houses are less crowded, I have estimated the mortality as occurring in a population of 84,000.* The total births for the year ending January 2nd, 1858, were 2868, and the deaths, after deducting the non-residents, were 2051, which shows an increase of 817 of births over deaths, and, if the same proportion of births over deaths has been maintained during the last six years, the population of this district will be about the number above stated. On referring to Table 14, it will be observed that during the six colder months, the mortality arising from diseases of the respiratory organs, is nearly double that of the other six months. This increased mortality is scarcely to be wondered at, when we consider the extreme poverty of many of the inhabitants, and how unable they are, from want of warm clothing, and from insufficiency of food and fuel, to resist the action of cold. During the last quarter, the deaths of children, under five years of age, from diseases of the respiratory organs, amounted to 84, or nearly a sixth part of the total number of deaths. The deaths from zymotic diseases during the last year, were 537, or about a fourth of the entire number of deaths, ten of which were cases of cholera. 436 deaths occurred from the tubercular or scrofulous class of diseases, in which is included consumption. 112 only are recorded as having died of old age. 227 inquests were held, in 35 of which, the verdict was " found dead," and in 32, "natural death." Stricture of the Urethra was fatal in 13 instances. As this is a disease generally attributable to Gonorrhoea, it will, for the future, be classed among the Zymotic Diseases. 58 cases of death were uncertified by any medical practitioner, among which, during the last quarter, was a young man, aged 21, said to have died of "disease of the heart another man, aged 66, registered as " sore throat and a third, a female, aged 9 weeks, the daughter of an unmarried woman, was registered as "pneumonia." All such cases probably are, as they undoubtedly ought to be, strictly enquired into by the local registrars, for if deaths be registered in a lax manner, facilities will be afforded for the commission of crime, and the security of the public will be endangered. During the last quarter, four deaths from the effects of poison are recorded, but in not one of these instances is the specific poison mentioned. Surely such an omission might be easily supplied. * The annual increase of the population in the metropolis is 2 per cent. 5 The 53 inquests which have been held upon persons dying in your district during the last three months, do not call for many observations. One of them, however, is rather remarkable, inasmuch as no post-mortem examination appears to have been instituted. The case was that of a youug woman, aged 17, wife of a surgeon, in the Goodman's Fields Registration District, and is thus recorded " found dead on the floor, apparently from natural causes." Another case, is that of a young man, aged 26, who was accidently crushed by a fall of three boxes of sugar, in consequence of the breaking of the chain which secured them. The place where this accident occurred is not given. This is the second death which has been recorded in your district during the past year, from the same cause, and the melancholy fact calls loudly upon the proprietors of warehouses, where cranes are used for unloading heavy goods, to see that the machinery, in all its parts, is in a perfectly sound state. The six cases of burns and scalds recorded during the past quarter, are all in consequence of the clothing of the parties catching fire. Forty-six persons in the district, during the past year, reached the advanced age of 80 and upwards, 3 of whom died at 90, and 1 at 91 years of age, during the last quarter. The mortality of children appears to vary considerably in the different subdistricts. In the Spitalfields, out of 85 deaths, 46 are of children under 5 years of age ; in the Aldgate, out of 65 deaths, 33 are of children under 5 ; in the Goodman's Fields, out of 69, there are 34; in the Mile End New Town, out of 89, there are 22 ; in the Whitechapel North, out of 128, there are 33 ; in the Artillery, out of 27, there are 8; and in the Whitechapel Church district, out of 146 deaths, there are only 26 of children under 5 years of age. The great difference in the relative mortality between adults' and children in the last named registration district, is accounted for by the mortality in the London Hospital, in which institution, very few young children are admitted. In those districts, in which there is neither a hospital nor workhouse, with the exception of the Artillery district, the deaths of children under 5 years of age, are more than half of the total mortality. On referring to the tables showing the mortality of the workhouses, it will be observed that out of the total mortality during the past year, a sixth part was due to zymotic diseases, but I may observe, that this forms no certain criterion of the unhealthiness of these institutions, inasmuch as, many of the patients who die in the workhouses, are admitted a few days only, before their death, they having suffered from disease, in some instances, a considerable time before their admission, and their deaths ought to be registered in the districts from which they were removed. It must also be borne in mind, that not a single case of fever, during the past year, was sent to the Fever Hospital, and only one case of small pox was sent to the Small Pox Hospital. The fact, , therefore, of all the fever cases, among the most destitute of the poor, being received into the workhouses, must tend, to a certain extent, to swell the mortality in these institutions. If we compare the mortality from epidemic diseases in the year 1856, with 6 that in 1857, it will appear that the mortality from these causes was greater during the latter than the former period. This difference is principally caused by the epidemic of diarrhoea, which occurred during the summer and autumn of 1857, which raised the mortality from this disease to 139 against 81 for the previous year. Typhus fever was not nearly so fatal, the deaths being for 1856, 188, and for 1857, 117. In small pox, there was a marked difference in favour of 1857, 31 against 3. In scarlet fever, there was a diminution of 2, whereas in measles, and hooping cough, there was an increase oi 48 in the former, and 25 in the latter. On comparing the mortality of epidemic diseases during the last quarter with that of the corresponding quarter of last year, it will be seen that there is an increase of 17, 98, including 4 deaths from cholera, being the number for 1857, and 81 for 1856; but it must be remembered, that the former period comprises 14 weeks, whereas the latter, 13 only. The total mortality of the workhouses during 1857, contrasts very favourably with the mortality in these institutions during the preceding year. The number of deaths in the two workhouses for 1857, was 272, and for 1856, 353. The deaths from fever and other zymotic diseases in the workhouses, were 46. The total number of out-door cases of sickness attended by the medical officers of the Union for the last quarter, was 2966, and the total number for the year, was 10,714, giving an average of 202 per week. The total number for 1856, was 9897, or an average of 190 per week. The number of cases of fever for the year 1857, was 1441, while for 1856, the number was 2239. The cases of fever occurring in the practice of the Medical Officers of the Union, were less in number than in any year since 1847, when they were 1157 only. On referring to Table 21, showing the localities where cases of fever came under the cognizance of the Medical Officers of the Union, and where deaths from zymotic diseases occurred, it will be seen that the greatest number of such cases and deaths, in proportion to the number of houses, were in the undermentioned places, viz:— Booth Street, Spitalfields, where, in 37 houses, 22 cases of fever, and 3 deaths from zymotic diseases occurred ; Grey Eagle Street, containing 68 houses, there were 26 cases of fever, and 10 deaths from zymotic diseases ; George Court, having only 4 houses, 5 cases of fever are recorded. 26 cases of fever, and 5 deaths from zymotic diseases occurred in the 67 houses in Princes Street, Mile End New Town; and in Dunk Street, out of 42 houses there were 44 cases of fever and 2 deaths from zymotic diseases. Little Love Court, Whitechapel, is shown to be even more unhealthy than the localities above-mentioned, for 14 cases of fever and 1 death occurred among the inhabitants of the 5 houses comprising the entire Court. I may also class among the most unhealthy localities, Queen Ann Street, Elizabeth Place, John Street, Crown Court, Moss Buildings, and Princes Street, Whiteehapel, in which places, out of 157 houses, 75 cases of fever and 14 deaths occurred. In a former report, I pointed out the unhealthy condition of Grey Eagle Street and George Court, Spitalfields, and strongly recommended that a sewer should be constructed in each of these localities, and I would now respectfully urge every 7 ber of the Board carefully to examine Table No. 2, in the appendix of this report, which points out the unhealthy localities in the district, so that all such places may receive the earliest and best attention of the Board. It must not be considered that, because comparatively few deaths from zymotic diseases are registered in some of these unhealthy places, that I am in error in thus pointedly alluding to them; for such is the poverty and wretchedness of many of the inhabitants of these localities, that when suffering from disease, they are removed to the workhouses, and if death ensue, swell the mortality in these establishments. Table No. 22, shows the localities where the house-to-house visitation has been carried out, and the sanitary improvements effected, from which it appears that almost all the unhealthy spots in the district have received the minute attention of your Inspectors of Nuisances; 150 places containing 2734 houses have been systematically visited, and a great improvement has been effected in most of them, by causing the landlords to construct efficient drainage to those houses where sewers existed within 100 feet of the premises, and where there were no sewers within the prescribed distance, by giving directions to the landlords to have the houses cleansed and limewhited, the privies to be emptied, and a better supply of water for domestic use to be provided; but such is the bad condition of many of the houses and localities inhabited by the poor, that they ought to be condemned as unfit for human habitation. We, perhaps, who have been living in the vicinity of these unhealthy spots for several years, and have had them, from time to time, brought under our notice, either by official reports, or by actual visitation, are not so sensible of the stiffing atmosphere which exists in the narrow culs-de-sac surrounded by houses inhabited by a dense population, as a stranger would be, who for the first time visited them. It is in these places that typhus fever, and analogous diseases are never absent, and not only are such diseases always found here, but scrofula, which manifests itself by its destructive agency in children, by hydrocephalus or water on the brain, by diseases of the mesenteric glands, by consumption, by ophthalmia, and spinal affections, producing blindness and deformity; and by other diseases, which if life be prolonged to the adult state, enfeeble the frame and cause early death ; and the mischief does not stop here, for if children be born of unhealthy parents, they inherit the same debilitated constitutions, and perish prematurely. The state in which the poor in this vast city are lodged, calls for the most earnest attention on the part of the community generally, and those in authority particularly, to endeavour to ameliorate the sanitary condition of their habitations ; and in order to do this, the courts and alleys must be paved, the sewerage and drainage rendered perfect, the water supply considerably improved, the overcrowding prevented, and the culs-de-sac converted into thoroughfares. It is true, that of late years a good deal has been done to improve the sanitary condition of the metropolis. Parks have been formed, burial grounds closed, new streets opened, the common lodging-houses inspected, and placed under the surveillance of the police, trades' nuisances abated, more wholesome water provided, better pavement laid down, improved cleansing of thoroughfares and bye places carried into effect, and the sewerage considerably extended, &c.; yet, unless improved 8 dwellings for the poor are erected, those glorious anticipations of reducing the rate of mortality in large towns to 15 or 17 in 1000, the at present estimated healthy standard will not be realized. As much has already been done with so much success to improve the health of the people, surely more may be accomplished. Our present state of knowledge may not enable us to remove all the causes of ill health, suffering, and premature death, but the subject of the excessive mortality in towns, must be kept constantly in view, and the most healthy slandard of comparison brought prominently before us, so that we may not act upon the supposition that the sanitary evils we see before us tending to shorten life are inevitable; it being now proved to demonstration that they are not so, as is shown by the diminution in the rate of mortality during the last few years, and we know, from experience, that what is, at one time, considered as insurmountable in the promotion of sanitary improvement is, at another, easily overcome. The wretched condition of many of the bouses in your district, is the subject to which I would more particularly direct your attention at the present time. Some of the houses are so totally unfitted for human habitation, that if diseases of the epidemic class be found to be frequent or fatal in them, I shall consider it to be my duty to call for your authority to apply to the police magistrate to order them to be shut up. No house, in my opinion, is fit for human habitation, if it be not properly ventilated, that is, having a current of air through it, and having a space either at the back or front, large enough to admit the rays of the sun. Light, and especially solar light, is so essential to the well-being of man, that unless he have it in sufficient quantity, he will fall into a state of disease, and his children become puny and imperfectly developed. A house, in any confined district, is also unfit for human habitation, if it have not a water-closet attached to it, and a proper covered receptacle for house refuse ; the common privies, which in many courts, are a most disgusting and offensive nuisance, occasioned, perhaps, not so much by the inhabitants living in the cours as by persons of the lowest class, prowling about the streets during the night. It would be very desirable, and I hope it will not be long before it is made compulsory upon every landlord to fit up, in each house, a properly constructed water-closet, and to abolish, by law, the existing public abominations, so detrimental to the health and morality of the inhabitants. Hitherto, our public improvements by the opening of new thoroughfares for the convenience of traffic, have not at all benefited the working classes, but in many respects have made their condition worse. Splendid shops and large houses, having a showy appearance have been built, which really do not appear to be wanted, while better houses for the working classes, which are needed, have not been provided. Docks, railways, warehouses, &c., must be constructed for the increase of the trade of this vast metropolis, but our constructing of them ought not to prevent us from providing better habitations for the working classes, whose labours effect these improvements; more especially as it is in the power of parishes, by virtue of an Act of Parliament, to encourage the establishment of improved lodging-houses for the labouring classes.* * Sec. 24 & 25 Vict. c. xxxii, 1851, An Act to encourage the establishment of Lodginghouses lor the labouring classes. 9 In the Whitechapel district, the number of houses does not increase with the increase of population. In 1841, the population of the Whitechapel district, exclu sive of those living on board of ship in the Docks, and the garrison in the Tower, was 71,765 who were living in 8834 houses, giving a population of 8.1 to a house. Ill 1851, the population had increased to 79,759, and the inhabited houses numbered 8,775, which gives rather more than 9 to each house ; and in 1856, the total number of houses (as taken from the rate-books in the several parishes in the district, including those uninhabited with the inhabited, allowing for a few errors) was 8934, which at the estimated population of 84,000, is at the rate of 9.4 to each house. But as the houses occupied by the more wealthy classes have not become more crowded, it is manifest, that the excess of the population is located in the poorer districts. Such being the case, it behoves all of us to exert ourselves to the utmost to remedy, as far as practicable, the sanitary evils which surround the poorer localities in this district, for we shall find that if the abodes of the poor are improved, we shall have less sickness, less widowhood and orphanage to provide for, the working classes would lose less time, which, to them, is money, and the happiness and comfort of all greatly promoted. From Table 17, in the appendix, it will be seen that the average age at death of males above 20 in the Whiteehapel district, is 50.2 years, while in more healthy districts, the average age at death of males above 20, is about 60 years; of, in other words, a man aged 20, may expect to live 40 years; whereas in the most healthy sub-district in Whiteehapel, for this class of persons, the expectation of life is only 33'6 years, and in the most unhealthy 24.5. The progressive improvement of the value of life in the Whiteehapel district from the year 1837, will be seen on referring to Table No. 16. In the years 1837 and 1838, the rate of mortality was 4.5 percent., whereas in 1857, it was reduced to 2.4 percent., or nearly one half. In London, during the 16th century, the mortality was 5 percent., or 50 out of every 1000 living. I have to draw the attention of the Board to a nuisance of considerable magnitude, which is observed in several of the principal thoroughfares in the district. I allude to the steam which is almost constantly escaping, in a greater or less degree, from the ventilating shafts of the sewers. This nuisance is not only of a dangerous character to the health of those persons who reside in the immediate vicinity of these gratings, by the fetid gases of the sewers becoming diffused with the hot steam, but immediate danger to life, or injury to the person, is to be dreaded by those who travel in two-wheel vehicles, in consequence of the horse taking fright and upsetting the carriage. Accidents have occurred, and in proportion to the increase of the ventilating gratings, so will the number of accidents become more numerous. The attention of the manufacturers who let off, at different times, large quantities of hot water, should be drawn to this subject, and they might probably be able to adopt some means to obviate this dangerous nuisance. I have also to direct attention to the nuisance arising from the escape of large volumes of dense smoke from the chimnies of several factories in the district, and as 10 the police are either unwilling, or do not feel that they have power in Whiteehapel parish, to take proceedings against the offending parties, the inhabitants of the district would be relieved from great discomfort and annoyance if the Board would exercise its authority and prosecute each offender ; and in order to direct the public where to make complaints respecting the smoke and all other nuisances; notice boards, as I suggested in my first report, should be placed in conspicuous parts of the district, giving the necessary information. I would further direct your attention to the nnisance committed against the obelisk in the centre of the Whitechapel High Street. This handsome and expensive structure was erected for the purpose of affording safety to persons crossing the wide thoroughfare in that locality ; but from the improper use which is made of the obelisk, persons are deterred from availing themselves of the accommodation it affords. The evil might be greatly remedied by attaching an iron railing to it, somewhat similar to that surrounding the statue in King William Street, in the City. In my first report, I enumerated 147 courts and bye-places in the district which required paving, and I regret that I cannot report that many of them have been improved since that time, now 16 months ago. Red Lion Court, Spitalfields, was inserted by mistake in the list of badly paved courts, and I take this opportunity of correcting the error. It is my duty in the Annual Report, to direct the attention of the Board to the progress made in sanitary improvements, and to the amount of work performed by their Inspectors. It appears from Table No. 1, in the appendix, that during the last quarter, 897 houses have been systematically visited, 958 nuisances inspected, 23 summonses taken out, and 212 notices served for the removal of nuisances. That since the commencement of the operations of your Board, 452 dust bins have been erected throughout the district, and orders would have been given for the erection of many more, had there been yards to all the houses in which they could have been placed, but in many instances the privy and water supply are in the cellar, and to insist upon a dust bin being placed alongside the water butt, it would not only contaminate the water, but would add to the unhealthiness of the house, by the giving off of the offensive gases from the decomposing house refuse, and which deleterious gases would make their way into every apartment. That nearly 5000 nuisances have been iuspected, 171 summonses served, (166 on the North, and 5 on the South side of the district), 42 of which were for nuisances in houses, such as offensive privies and cesspools, and 129 for other nuisances, among which, were several summonses for the keeping of swine. In consequence of your Inspectors experiencing considerable difficulty in preventing the recurrence of the nuisance of the keeping of swine, by proceeding under the provisions of the Nuisance Removal Act, (the defendants evading the penalty by the temporary removal of the swine, until after the hearing of the summons, and then bringing them back again to the same place,) Mr. Coward has latterly taken out summonses against the parties under the 57 George 3rd, cap. xxix, commonly known as "Michael Augelo Taylor's Act," the 68th section of which enacts, " That no person or persons at any time, shall breed, 11 leed, or keep any kind or species of swine in any house, building, yard, garden, or other hereditaments, situate and being in or within forty yards of any street or public place in any parochial or other district, &c., and that any person or persons so offending, shall forfeit or pay for every such offence, the sum of 40s., and shall also forfeit the said swine to the Commissioners or Trustees, &c." In both these cases a pecuniary fine was inflicted. It may be desirable to mention, that a summons was taken out by Mr. Co ward at the Worship Street Police Court, under the Nuisances Removal Act, " For that certain houses situate in Little Love Court, were in such a condition as to be unfit for human habitation," and on proof of which, an order was made by the magistrate, "prohibiting the use thereof for that purpose until rendered fit for that purpose," &c. An order for the ejectment of the tenants was also made, which was carried into effect. The houses in question have since been ventilated, cleansed, and limewhited throughout. Another summons was taken out by Mr. Cowakd, under the Police Act, against a woman named Wood, residing in New Castle Street, for throwing dirt and ashes in the thoroughfare. A conviction was obtained, and a small fine inflicted. This poor woman, most probably in ignorance of the law, committed the offence, and was very properly leniently dealt with; but what apology can be made for the Eastern Counties Railway Company, who hold the greater portion of Phosnix Street, Quaker Street, and King Street, in which, nuisances highly prejudicial to health, have been repeatedly found to exist, and who, instead of at once carrying out the orders necessary for the abatement of these nuisances, delay the matter, and summonses are obliged to be served to compel them to effect the required improvements. If a fine in all such cases of wilful neglect were inflicted, the orders of your Inspectors would be more promptly obeyed. The annual visit of the several slaughter-houses was again made by committees of your Board, accompanied by your Medical Officer of Health, and Inspectors of Nuisances, when, in most instances, the regulations adopted by your Board, respecting these places had been complied with, and in those where the regulations had not been strictly observed, the parties faithfully promised to carry them out, and have done so. The cow-houses in the district are, from time to time, visited, and in 38 instances, orders for the better cleansing of them have been given. The nuisance arising from the cows being kept in a cellar under the pavement in Hooper Square, has been abated. It is not, however, as yet, entirely removed; but the proprietor having other premises in the neighbourhood, it is most probable that he will altogether abandon the cellar for the lodgment of his cows, and cease to annoy his neighbours and the public, with the offensive ammoniacal smell which issues from his premises. Great improvements have been made in several parts of the district from the pulling down of houses which were in a dilapidated and dangerous condition, and thereby causing a better ventilation to some of the closely-confined neighbourhoods, amongst which may be mentioned, Dunk Street, Booth Street, Plough Court, Halifax 12 Street, Pelham Street, Peter's Court, Johnson's Back Change, Swallow's Gardens, and Prescott Place. In Pelham Street, a block of new lodging-houses has been erected, each house being calculated to contain two families, and is fitted up with every convenience. A large private lodging-house has also been opened in Osborne Place, in which the apartments are well ventilated, clean, and well adapted for the convenience of the inmates. Here, the drainage is good, and water supply abundant, and if the rooms are not permitted to be overcrowded, there is every prospect that this building will afford a healthy residence for several poor people. Since the date of my last report, verdicts of "guilty" have been obtained against the two sugar-refiners, alluded to in one of my former reports, for the nuisance occasioned by the re-burning of animal charcoal. In both cases, considerable alterations have been made to their premises, with a view of abating the nuisance so justly and strongly complained of. In the one case, the improvements which have been made, appear to have had the effect of preventing the escape into the immediate neighbourhood of the noxious gases arising from the process of the re-burning of the animal charcoal, for no complaints are now made either to your Board or to your Officers; but in the other case, further improvements are required, as the nuisance is not satisfactorily abated, and the success, which the firm had anticipated from the alterations, has not as yet been attained. Proceedings have been taken against certain bone boilers, and bone crushers, &c., in the district, and such arrangements have been made with each party as to place the Board in a position effectually to prevent annoyance and injury to the public from the disgusting effluvia from these premises. I stated in my last report, that I hoped to be able to inform the Board that the nuisance arising from the Refinery Premises belonging to Sir Anthony Rothchild, adjoining the Royal Mint, had been effectually suppressed, but I regret to state, that the nuisance still continues. Sir Anthony Rothchild, however, has expressed his readiness to adopt all practicable alterations for the removal of the nuisance, and it is to be hoped that his intention will be forthwith carried into effect, as the nuisance is of such a description, as to be highly prejudicial to the health and comfort of persons residing within its influence. In consequence of the very irregular manner in which some of the streets, and most of the bye places are numbered, very considerable difficulty has been found in localizing all the cases of fever and other diseases, and as there are many places in the district bearing the same name, there will perhaps be found some inaccuracy in the table showing the mortality from zymotic diseases and cases of fever in the various localities of the district, so far as those courts are concerned, which bear the same name in the same registration district. I would, therefore, respectfully urge the Board to cause the name to be legibly affixed to every street and court in the district, and the number of each house to be conspicuously painted, either on, or above the door. There are 149 streets and places which require the names to be affixed to them. In many streets, the same number will be found on several doors; and on others, there are no numbers at all. 13 Much satisfaction has been expressed by many of the poor in various parts of the district by the new and additional privy accommodation which has been erected for their use, and for the New Sewer which has been constructed in Shepherd Street, Tenter Ground, Spitalfields, where nearly the whole of the houses had cesspools, but since the sewer has been constructed, the cesspools have been abolished, and every house is now properly drained. It is my painful duty again to record the fact that many of the syphoned-trapped pans, &c., which have been attached to the privies by order of your Inspectors, have not answered the purpose for which they were intended, inasmuch as they have become broken by the ignorant and violent endeavours to clear them from the portions of jackets, old shoes, and other worn-out articles of dress, which have been thrown down them, and it becomes a matter well worthy the consideration of the Board, whether some better contrivance can be substituted for the pans and traps now in use, to relieve the inhabitants from the effluvia of privies, until education shall have made more progress among the people. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, 15, Great Alie Street, 8th February, 1858. JOHN LIDDLE. APPENDIX TABLE I.

The fee required for the Registration of a birth after six weeks has elapsed, deters poor people from performing this neccesary duty.

Read to the Board, August 16th, 1858. LONDON: PRINTED BY T. PENNY, 121, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, AND 9, LONDON TERRACE, HACKNEY ROAD, 1858. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have now the honor of submitting to you my Quarterly Report of the mortality of the Whitechapel District, and the progress of sanitary improvement therein, for the 13 weeks that ended on Saturday, July 3rd. During this period, out of a population of about 84,000, there were 538 deaths, 294 males, and 244 females, including 50 non-residents, who died in the London Hospital. The births during the same period were 687,—333 males, and 354 females. The number of deaths, although greater than for the corresponding quarter of last year, is below the average rate of mortality for the five last years, the deaths for the corresponding quarter of 1853 being 551; of 1854, 599; and of 1855, 584; including the deaths of non-residents. The deaths of children under 5 years of age, bear a much greater proportion to the total number of deaths, than in the corresponding quarter of last year ; the deaths of young children, for the quarter recently terminated, being 265 out of 538, or about 49 per cent.; whereas, for the corresponding quarter of 1857, the deaths were 213, out of 521, or 40 per cent. only; but if we deduct from the total mortality, the deaths in the London Hospital, in which institution 2 deaths only of children under 5 years occurred, it will be seen that the total mortality under 5 years in the Whitechapel District, is about 56 per cent., a proportion so large that it deserves our most serious attention. It appears that diseases most fatal to the young, are measles, hoopingcough, diarrhoea, mesenteric disease, convulsions, and diseases of the respiratory organs, (bronchitis and pneumonia.) Six children died from the want of breast milk, and 11 from premature birth. How to overcome this frightful, and apparently increasing amount of mortality of the young, is a problem well worthy the attentive consideration of every citizen; the time may be far distant before this problem is solved; nevertheless, it is my duty to chronicle facts, and although I may not be able to suggest a remedy to meet this evil, still, the knowledge that so large an amount of infant mortality does exist in our district, I may say, at our very doors, will, perhaps, rouse the attention of the philanthropist, the man of science, and the man of leisure, to investigate its cause, and endeavour to mitigate it. It is impossible to say how much of this evil is owing to overcrowding and other defective sanitary conditions, how much is owing to want of attention of parents, and how much to poverty, and insufficient food and clothing. The 4 first of these causes we have it in our power to remedy, and I trust that by our exertions, judiciously applied, this cause will be removed; but as regards the other mentioned causes of the great and disproportionate mortality, I fear that the powers of this Board will be unable to overcome them. As might be expected, during the warmer months comprising the last quarter, the deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs have been less numerous; they being for the winter quarter, ending April 3rd, 23 per cent.; and for this quarter, 17 per cent. Consumption proved fatal to 57, or about 10 per cent., which is about the same proportion to the total mortality as for the preceding quarter. The deaths from epidemic diseases have increased from 73 to 106, as compared with the quarter ending June, 1857; the great increase is in measles, 14 against 37. There is not much variation in the number of deaths from the other epidemics. The following cases of death from zymotic diseases are also recorded; 2 from diptheria, 2 from cholera, 1 from rheumatic fever, 2 from syphilis, and 2 from erysipelas. The deaths from old age were 28, 14 of which occurred to persons of 80 years and upwards.* In the week ending Saturday, May 29th, 1 death only from epidemic disease (hoopingcough) was recorded in this district. As 10 deaths only (a number considerably below the average) were uncertified by a medical practitioner, I am in hopes that this class of cases will still further diminish, and that ere long nearly every death will be duly certified. There is only one of the uncertified deaths which requires notice : it is that of a male, aged 72, registered as "rupture." I presume that, in this case, the registrar, by personal enquiries, was satisfied that it was properly recorded. The number of inquests held was 56, and they are thus classified: in 17 instances, Or in nearly one-third, the verdict was "found dead"; in 5, "Natural death"; 9 were cases of burns and scalds, 7 of which were occasioned by the clothes taking fire, the other 2 were scalds; 1 of these was a man, aged 22, who fell into a pan of boiling sugar; 19 were cases of violence, including wounds; 3 of poison, 2 of which were from the effects of ardent spirits, and the other from laudanum taken to procure rest, and not with the intention of self-destruction; 2 were cases of accidental death from drowning, one by falling into the docks, the other into the river; 1 from suffocation, the infant being found dead in bed. Included in the above list are 2 cases of suicide, one from hanging, the other from a wound in the throat. The number of sick poor attended by the Medical Officers of the Union, during the last quarter, was 3334, including the 379 attended in the workhouses. For the year ending January 3rd, the number was 10,714, exclusive of about 1700 attended in the Workhouses, making a total of about 12,414. As the number of sick poor in *The Registrar General appends the subjoined note to his weekly return for the 26th June:—"No. 1, Brownson's Court, Alie Street, a gentleman, aged 108 years, 'diarrhœa senectus.' The Registrar says: 'The medical certificate states the age at 108. I am hardly able to say whether that was his exact age. I have seen the relatives, and there appears a little confusion about dates; some say he is a little older, and others that he is not so old, but all agree that he is several years beyond his hundredth. From what I can gather, he has retained his faculties to the last, has been through life a most temperate and abstemious mail, and possessed, in an extraordinary degree, a cheerful flow of spirits,'" this district appears to be so much larger, (not only relatively but actually) than in all the other parishes in the Metropolis, with the exception of the very large parish of Marylebone, I have thought it my duty to mention the circumstance. In Shoreditch, with a population of about 109,000, the number of sick poor attended by the Medical Officers of the parish, was, for the quarter ending 3rd July, including those in the workhouse, 3027, or 307 less than in Whitechapel; in Bethnal Green, with a population of about 102,000, the number of sick poor for the whole year was 6772, being only rather more than half the number that are attended in Whitechapel; and in Saint Pancras, with a population of about 195,000, the number was, for the 53 weeks, ending January 3rd, 1858, exclusive of those in the workhouse, 7797, and as the cases in the workhouse average about 40 per week, there must be added to the 7797, 2120, making a total of 9917, or about 1497 less in the year than in the Whitechapel District.* By order of the Board, in June last, I reported upon the state of the water in St. Katherine's Dock. I found the water somewhat turbid, and it was offensive to the smell. It contained a considerable quantity of organic matter, but it did not evolve sulphuretted hydrogen. I also tested it for copper, but no trace of that metal was found in it. Whilst visiting the dock, I was informed that the smell of the water was entirely owing to the offensive state of the river; and it was even alleged, that the water in the dock was not so bad as the Thames itself. This is probably a mistake, for the dock obtains its supply of water from the river, and adds to it the nuisances from the ships alongside the quays, in addition to which, the water is contaminated by the emanations from the filth at the bottom of the dock, which is at times partially stirred up and removed, to enable the ships to have more free ingress and egress; moreover the dock, as I have been informed, has, on no occasion, been thoroughly cleansed since it has been built, a period of about 30 years; the offensive state of the deposit may be therefore tolerably well conceived. I also reported that the nuisance arising from the premises of Sir Anthony Rothschild was still complained of, and that the remedies which had been hitherto applied to abate the nuisance were not sufficient for the purpose. I further reported that I called upon several manufacturers in the district, from whose premises opaque smoke was emitted, and since my visit the nuisance has been somewhat abated. The smell from the re-burning of animal charcoal upon the premises of Messrs. Elers & morgan, was made a subject of complaint; but as Mr. Morgan intimated to me that he would immediately adopt means to abate the nuisance, I am in great hopes there will be no further cause of complaint. If, however, complaints are again made, I shall bring the subject a second time under your notice. *Since writing the above I have received an account of the number of out-door sick poor, attended in the subjoined Parishes and Unions, for the Quarter ending April 3rd, 1858,— Paddington, 101; Chelsea, 676; Belgravia, 448; St. Martins' in the Fieids, 184; St. Marylebone, 5003; St. Pancras, 2126; Islington, 1798; Hackney, 780; St. Giles, 14-06; Strand, 390; Holborn, 914; St. Luke, 1420; Bethnal Green, 1381; Whitechapel, 3009; Bow, 446; St. George, Southwark, 1347; Newington, 754 ; Camberwell, 1047. 6 I also reported upon several other trades-nuisances, such as malt roasting, soap making, &c., and in all these instances the proprietors expressed their willingness to use the best practicable means to destroy the noxious effluvia from their premises. The bone-boiling premises, in the neighbourhood of Thomas Street, appear to be as offensive as ever, and complaints of the smell from them continue to be made. From the returns of the Inspectors of Nuisances, it appears that during the last quarter 271 houses have been systematically visited, that 984 nuisances of various kinds have been inspected, 178 cesspools abolished, and 105 cesspools cleansed, where there was no sewerage within 100 feet of the premises; but for the further particulars of the work done by the Inspectors, I must refer you to the Tables I., II., & XV. The house-to-house visitation still continues to be attended with beneficial results. The following case was discovered by Mr. Coward, in the course of his visitation. At 10, Duke Street, Old Artillery Ground, in one room, there slept a man and his wife, their son, 15 years of age, and their daughter, about 19 or 20, also another daughter who was pregnant, and a young man who lived with her, making a total in this room of six, three males, and three females, all adults. This house was reported to the police, and is now registered as a common lodging-house; the recurrence, therefore, of such a state of demoralization will be prevented. The overcrowding which exists in this district, perhaps, to a great extent, is owing to the extreme poverty of the people, 2s. or even 1s. 6d. a week, being more than many can afford to pay for a room. If, therefore, healthy houses could be built, so as to enable the proprietors to let each room for 1s. per week, great advantages would accrue to our working population; and this subject is well worthy the consideration of benevolent individuals, and parochial authorities, who have power under the provisions of two acts of parliament,* to erect improved dwellings for the labouring class. It cannot be too often impressed upon our minds, that sickness among the poor is the great cause of pressure upon the rates, and everything that will tend to diminish the number of sick, will be so much saved to the rate-payers. If it be true, as is predicted, that we are to have a succession of hot summers, it more especially behoves us, during the ensuing winter months, to hasten on our sanitary improvements, by causing the unpaved and badly paved courts to be paved, and to abolish all cesspools within 100 feet of a sewer. Nine of the private courts in this district,† where the pavement was in so dilapidated a state as to prevent the water from flowing off, thereby, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, causing, or likely to cause, ill health to the inhabitants, have been paved at the expense of the owners, upon notices being served upon them by the Inspectors; and two other of the private courts‡ have been paved by order of *The 14 and I5 V., c. 34, entitled "The Labouring Classes Lodging House Act," and the 18 and 19 V., c. 132, entitled "The Labourers' Dwellings Act." † Hampshire Court, Tongue Yard, Little Tongue Yard, Drum Yard, Hunt Court, Rosetta Place, John's Place, Hobb's Court, and Crown Court, Quaker Street. ‡ Marlborough Court and Little Love Court. 7 the Magistrate, upon legal proceedings being taken by the Board, inconsequence of the owners neglecting to comply with the requirements of the Inspectors; and if your Board had sanctioned the further proceedings of your Medical Officer of Health, in giving directions to the Inspectors to serve notices on all owners whose property was in an unhealthy condition from defective paving; it is probable that very few of the private courts, which are not thoroughfares, would at this time be unpaved. The necessity of causing all courts to be well paved, I have, in my Quarterly Reports, more than once alluded to; and I again most respectfully, but earnestly entreat the Board, at once to carry into effect this most necessary measure. A more favorable time than the present for proceeding with sanitary improvements is never likely to occur; we are free from the prevalence of any epidemic, and hence our sanitary improvements can be judiciously carried into effect, and without hurry; for when works are begun hurriedly, under the panic of a devastating pestilence, it is seldom that they are completed in a satisfactory manner. Sanitary improvements have hitherto, for the most part, been made under the influence of fear, and when it has passed away, things have been allowed to relapse to their former condition, until the same fear is again excited by the recurrence of the pestilence. If the minds of the public at large were only as thoroughly convinced of the importance of exercising a constant Supervision over the crowded localities of large towns, as are the minds of those who have devoted long and anxious attention to the subject, most of the sanitary defects in them would soon be remedied, and the rate of mortality of the people consequently be still further reduced, and greater happiness be the lot of all mankind. The legislature has at length wisely entrusted the local Boards with ample powers to enforce the removal of those sanitary evils, which in the opinion of the Medical Officers of Health, are causing, or are likely to cause disease; and the benefits resulting from the exercise of such powers are clearly shown in this, and in my former Reports—in the reduction of the rate of mortality,—in the diminution of those cases of low fever, which were so prevalent among the poor, and in the general reduction of the poor-rate. I must now direct your serious attention to the most important subject, in a sanitary point of view, which can be brought before you. I allude to the existence of cesspools, more especially to such as are situated either in the cellars of inhabited houses, or in the small back-yards which are surrounded by the walls of houses filled with lodgers. Experience has proved to us, that it is in these places ill health is always to be observed, and this lowering of the system renders the inhabitants prone to receive the poison of any prevailing epidemic; for although we may not be able satisfactorily to demonstrate that the poisonous exhalations of cesspools actually produce epidemic diseases, there can be no doubt of the fact that the greatest number of victims of pestilential diseases are to be found in those localities where such nuisances exist. That the exhalations of cesspools are poisonous, is now universally admitted, for they have been made the subject of direct experiment. Dogs have been subjected to 8 their influence, and have in consequence suffered more or less in their health; vomiting and diarrhoea have attacked those animals which have been compelled to inhale the emanations of cesspools. Having mentioned these facts, it is my duty, as the local Medical Officer of Health, to point out to the Board the importance of removing, as expeditiously as possible, and in the least offensive manner, the contents of all cesspools in our densely populated district; and for the accomplishment of this purpose I most earnestly advise, that where a cesspool exists within 100 feet of a sewer, that such cesspool be filled up, the drains be properly trapped, and made to communicate with the sewer. The old method of emptying a cesspool, by carrying the contents in buckets through the house, and depositing the filth in a cart, to be conveyed through the streets, is exceedingly objectionable, and under certain conditions of the atmosphere, is likely to be productive of a serious injury to the public health; besides, it is impossible to get rid of the smell of a cesspool by emptying it in this manner; a sufficient quantity of the filth will always remain, to produce the same pernicious and offensive odour. No cesspool ought to be allowed to exist in London, for wherever there is a cesspool, the ground in its vicinity is completely saturated with the foul and putrifying liquid contents ; the stench from which is continually rising up and infecting the air which is breathed by the people, and in some instances, poisoning the water which is drawn from the public pumps. I would, moreover, ask if it be decent or proper to allow human beings to live in the midst of their own ordure, when such a state of things is instinctively avoided by the lower animals. In my former reports I pointed out how the health of this district had been improved, and I have now to refer you to the table of the cases of sickness, which have been attended, during the last quarter, by the medical officers of the Union, where it appears that the average number of cases of fever per week, have been ten only, whereas, for the corresponding quarter of last year, they were 25, and if we examine the tables in my previous Eeports, it will be seen that the average number of fever cases per week, attended by the Medical Officers of the Union, for the year ending January 3rd, 1857, were 27, and for the year, 1856, they averaged 43 per week; and if we refer to the records of fever cases for 1855, it will be found that they amounted to an average of 52 per week.* This most remarkable and highly satisfactory result, showing clearly the connexion between sanitary improvement and the diminution of fever cases,—that class of disease which occasions more suffering to the poor, and greater expense to the ratepayers than any other,—must surely convince the most sceptical of the advantages of carrying into effect the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act; and no. *The number of Fever Cases in 1838 were 2537; in 1839, 1976; in 1840, 1145; in 1841, 1118; in 1842, 724; in 1843, 1185; in 1844, 1563; in 1845, 1467; 1846, 864; in 1847, 1157; in 1848, 4113; in 1849, 2189; in 1850, 1684; in 1851, 2053; in 1852, 2322; in 1853, 2175; in 1854, 2112; in 1855, 2721; in 1856, 2239 ; in 1857, (53 weeks) 1441. 9 one can reasonably doubt that the abolition of 1540† cesspools has been mainly instrumental in bringing it about. If we are compelled to make a choice between the certain deleterious effects of cesspools, when situated in close proximity to inhabited houses, and the effects of the exhalations of the Thames upon the public health, we cannot for a moment hesitate to say which of the two evils is the most injurious. It is a singular fact, that while the Thames was so offensive, the public health was comparatively good, but this fortunate coincidence by no means justifies us in converting the river into a common sewer; until, however, a different system of main drainage is effected, there is no help for it. My duty, as the local Officer of Health, is to endeavour to purify the atmosphere surrounding the habitations of the people, by removing every thing which has a tendency to contaminate it; and it is not my province to discuss the question relating either to the purification of the Thames, or the main drainage of London. I am thoroughly convinced, by the result of experience, that the existence of cesspools and overcrowding are the chief causes of ill health; I must therefore use my earnest exertions to remove those evils. The beneficial effects produced upon the public health, by the substitution of water-closets for the old privy and cesspool, have not been confined to the metropolis, but have been co-extensive with such substitution in all large towns, and so deeply do I feel the importance of this exchange, that were I, in any known instance where practicable to effect such a substitution, and not to urge its adoption, I should fail in my duty as your Medical Officer of Health. If the sullage, which is now not only wasted, but permitted to contaminate the river, can be turned to account, I shall rejoice, but in the mean time, I must use my best endeavours to cause to be carried away, by the agency of water, all cesspool filth from every inhabited house. In my first Quarterly Report, I stated that all complaints of nuisances were without delay inquired into by yonr inspectors, and the localities where fever prevailed were promptly visited, and a notice to remove any nuisance was served upon the owner of the premises where such nuisance existed ; and if the nuisance were not removed within a given time, the sanction of your Board was requested to allow further proceedings to be taken. This plan has hitherto worked extremely well, if the number of nuisances, (12,870) which have been removed, and the diminution of fever cases, (from 43 to 10 weekly) be criterions of its efficiency; I therefore hope that the Board will allow the same system to be continued; for if persons be willing to remove nuisances, simply by a notice from your inspectors, the delay which will necessarily be occasioned in bringing each case before you will be avoided, and your *To this number most be added those cesspools which have been abolished by the several parties who had been anxious to avail themselves of the benefits of the sewers in the immediate vicinity of their property, by obtaining the permission of the Surveyor to connect their drains with the main sewer; but as the Surveyor has not kept a separate account of those who have made a communication with the sewer, upon a notice served by the Inspectors, and those who have voluntarily done so, I cannot give the exact number. The Surveyor has kindly promised for the future, to keep the cases distinct. 10 officers be left more free to extend their labours in a given time over a greater area, in the prosecution of the important work of house-to-house visitation, and the removal of nuisances. It may be desirable that the Board, at every meeting, should be made acquainted with the work done by the Inspectors; and I shall for the future, lay before you, in my weekly statement, an account of the number of houses visited, and the works which are required in each case to be carried out, which will afford an opportunity to any person upon whom a notice has been served, to appear before the Board, or Committee of Works, and urge his objection against the carrying into effect the orders of your Inspectors. I have in this Report, as in duty bound, spoken plainly; if in the opinion of some members of the Board, too plainly, my apology is, the deep sense I entertain of the importance of sanitary progress, for upon the success that shall attend the labours of those engaged in this most sacred cause, depends the improvement of the social, moral, and intellectual condition of the people.

BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT. REPORT ON The Sanitary condition of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, for the THREE MONTHS ENDING OCTOBER 2nd, 1858. Read to the Board, November 15th, 1858. LONDON: PRINTED BY T. PENNY, 121, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, AND 9, LONDON TEEEACE, hackney ROAD, 1858 REPORT. Gentlemen, 0 On comparing the mortality in the Whitechapel District, for the 13 weeks ending on Saturday, October 2nd, 1858, with the corresponding 13 weeks of the year 1857, it will be seen that very little variation has taken place in the number of deaths. There were registered during the former period, 547 ; and during the latter, 551—the deaths of non-residents being included in each return. The deaths in the London Hospital (which always swell the mortality in this district above its fair average proportion) amount to 68, of which, 37 are of persons nonresident in the district, 6 of persons whose residences are not given, and 19 of persons whose death was occasioned by violence, the former residences of whom are not stated in the local registrars' returns. But as we have no account of the deaths of our own parishioners who die in the several charitable institutions in the metropolis, we may approximate with tolerable accuracy to the correct mortality of the district, if we include in it all the cases of death in the London Hospital, caused by injuries ; as the defect in the record of the one, will compensate for the excess in the other. The deaths from Epidemic diseases have been less numerous; 162 were recorded during the quarter recently terminated, and 167 for the corresponding quarter of last year. It is exceedingly gratifying to me to be able to state that, owing to the very efficient manner in which vaccination is performed in this district, not a single death from small-pox has occurred. Measles, on the other hand, has proved fatal to 22; scarlet fever to 27; hooping cough to 22; whereas, for the corresponding quarter of last year, the deaths from those diseases were 16, 14, and 13 respectively : but diarrhoea and typhus fever have been less fatal; the deaths from the former having diminished from 102 to 71. and the latter from 21 to 20. Among the deaths from Zymotic diseases, are included 4 from cholera, 4 from child-bed fever, 2 from rheumatic fever, and 3 from diptheria. The deaths of children under 5 years of age, were 283, or nearly 52 per cent. of the total mortality; but, if we exclude, as on previous occasions, the deaths of non- 4 resident adults, the proportion will be increased to 55 per cent.. Diarhœa, measles, hooping cough, convulsions, mesenteric disease, bronchitis, and pneumonia, appear to be the most powerful agencies for producing this great destruction of infant life. Of 47 inquests held on persons dying in this district, in 15, the verdict was, either " found dead," or "natural death." There were 3 cases of suicide; one by hanging, one by a musket shot, and one by poison (laudanum.) There were 2 cases of death from the effects of burns and scalds, one of which was a child, aged 3 years, from drinking water from a tea kettle. Among the cases of death from violence, is that of a servant, aged 11 years, who accidentally fell from a window. I mention this as a warning to heads of families, not to allow female servants to clean the outside of windows, if there be any possibility of danger from falling, as such calamities are of frequent occurrence. There is only one more case where an inquest was held, to which I think it necessary to direct your attention. It is that of a woman, aged 63, who resided at 43, Spicer Street, who was supposed to have died from "Exhaustion from want of Food," having been neglected for more than two days. I have made enquiry respecting this case, and learnt that "the woman was separated from her husband, and was in full work as a weaveress"; she was not in destitute or distressed circumstances, and her fellow lodgers heard her at work on the Saturday preceding her death. Her room was entered on the Tuesday following, when she was found upon the floor alive, and it was supposed she had fallen out of her loom while at work, apparently in a fit. Ten cases of death were not certified by any medical practitioner, 5 of which were in the Mile End New Town registration district. These cases relate principally to children, and are registered in the columns—hooping cough, measles, diarrhœa, debility, want of breast milk, and convulsions. There is one case, however, a male, aged 43, registered in the Artillery district, as apoplexy; and another in the Goodman's Fields district, as acute rheumatism. The births during the past quarter were 604; and the deaths, excluding the 37 non-residents, 510; the increase, therefore, of births over deaths was 94; but as it is probable that not all the births are registered, the increase may exceed that amount. The increase of population in those districts, where new houses are continually being built, is looked upon with satisfaction; but such cannot be the ease, in one like the Whitechapel district, where almost every available space is already occupied by buildings, and where the consequence of an increasing population must be to render more unhealthy the already overcrowded houses. Not only are the houses in this district becoming more and more crowded by the increase of the population, but the overcrowding is increased by the displacements of the poor tenants who occupied the several houses which have been taken down for the various improvements recently made. The Whitechapel District continues to afford evidence that it is not unfavorable to longevity, 19 deaths being recorded of persons of 80 years of age and upwards. A female, aged 94, died in the Union Workhouse, in which institution are also recorded the deaths of two males and one female, each at the advanced age of 87 years. 5 The greatest number of deaths that occurred in any one week, during the quarter, was for that ending on Saturday, the 31st July, when 65, including 9 inquests, were registered; and the smallest number was for the week ending on Saturday, the 4th September, when 31 deaths, including 5 inquests, were recorded; the average number of deaths per week, for the 13 weeks terminating on the 2nd October, excluding non-residents, was 39.2. Among the unspecified cases of death, there are recorded that of a female child, aged 12 months, which the medical attendant certified as "probably smothered in bed," and that of a newly born child, found in a loft, over a copper, on the ground floor of a house in the Whitechapel road. In the former case, an inquest was not held, but in the latter it was deemed necessary to hold one, when the jury returned the verdict of ''Found dead." The crime of infanticide does not appear to be of frequent occurrence in this district, and it is to be hoped that this is not an instance of it. There are two cases of death of rather unusual occurrence, both certified by medical practitioners, one of paralysis of the oesophagus, or gullet; the other, of thecal abscess, or whitlow, in a child 9 years of age, to the certificate of which the medical attendant appends the subjoined remarks, "Exhaustion, sudden. It is difficult to assign a cause, as the whitlow (a very bad one), was nearly well, and no internal disease was discovered at the post mortem examination." The number of new cases of sickness attended by the medical officers of the union, exclusive of those in the workhouse, was 2862. In the workhouse, there were 292 cases of sickness, 147 of which were attended by Mr. Champneys, and 145 by Mr. Richardson. On comparing the total number of cases of sickness among the out-door poor with that for the corresponding quarter of last year, it will be seen that there is a diminution of 272; and, if we compare the average number of fever cases for the same quarter, we shall find that they are reduced from an average of 29 to an average of 9 weekly. The annual visitation of the slaughter-houses in the district, has been recently made, and all those premises which had previously been licensed were reported as being in a satisfactory condition, that is to say, the necessary requirements insisted upon by your Board were complied with. It would, however, be very desirable in a sanitary point of view, if nil the slaughter-houses were removed out of this densely populated district. A slaughter-house in a crowded neighbourhood is generally admitted to be a nuisance. I have, at least, no hesitation in expressing my opinion that a slaughter-house situated in the midst of dwelling houses is a nuisance injurious to the public health, for the following reasons:— 1st. There is unavoidably the offensive effluvium of slaughtering and dressing the carcases of the animals. 2nd. The offensive effluvium arising from the crowding together, in a small space, the animals before they are slaughtered, renders the surrounding air less healthy. 3rd. The blood which sometimes flows into tanks or wells soon putrifies, when it emits most foul and poisonous exhalations. 4th. The dung-heap, which is usually in the immediate vicinity of the slaughter-house, gives out a most offensive and disgusting odour, and if the premises be too small to afford room for a dung-pit, the refuse and filth are carried to 6 the nearest laystall, increasing its bulk and offensiveness. 5th. The ordure which is dropped from the animals on their way to the slaughter houses, tends to render the air impure. The slaughtering of cattle has, moreover, a brutalizing influence upon all persons, and especially the young, who witness the operation. Great inconvenience, nearly constant annoyance, and frequent danger are experienced, by the inhabitants living in the vicinity of these places, from the driving and goading the animals over the footways of the main thoroughfares, and through the narrow and confined localities in which many of these premises are situated. And lastly, cattle, when driven through the streets of London into the several slaughter-houses, where they are frequently crowded together in a small space, become unhealthy, and the quality of the meat is deteriorated. For these, and other reasons, I am decidedly of opinion that, the slaughtering of cattle should be carried on in properly constructed places, at a reasonable distance from the crowded districts of London, and to which the public should not have access. I do not apprehend that the inhabitants of London will suffer any inconvenience from such a regulation, more especially when it appears that a very large quantity of dead meat is sent up from various parts of the United Kingdom for the supply of the London Markets. The recent City regulations regarding slaughter-houses are more stringent than those adopted by your Board; there can be no good reason therefore, why the same regulations, if just in themselves, and beneficial to the public, should not be enforced within this—the contiguous district.* * The regulations in the City of London as regards slaughter-houses, are as follows:— "1. That each slaughter-house be paved with asphalte or with flag-stone set in cement, and be laid with proper slope and channels towards a gully. "2. That each slaughter-house be effectually drained by an adequate drain, communicating directly with the public sewer: that the gully at the inlet communicating with the drain be well trapped with a stone-ware syphon trap, or other trap of approved form and construction, and be covered with a fixed grating, the liars not to be more than three-eighths of an inch apart. "3. That each slaughter-house be provided with adequate cisternage and water supply, and be thoroughly washed and cleansed directly after the slaughtering is completed. "4. That each slaughter-house be adequately ventilated by louvre boards or otherwise, so as not to be offensive to the neighbours. "5. That no cesspool for blood or other purpose be permitted to remain, or be constructed within any slaughter-house. "6. That the internal surface of each slaughter-house to the height of ten feet, including any pound, be lime-whited at Lady-day and Michaelmas-day, or within one week after each, and ðfierier if required ; and the whole of the interior, at or about Midsummer-day. "7. That the blood, fat, skins, filth, and offal of all animals slaughtered between six o'clock in the evening and five o'clock in the morning of each day, be removed from every slaughter-house within this city, before six o'clock in the morning; and of all animals slaughtered between five o'clock in the morning and six o'clock in the evening of each day, be removed between the hours of six o'clock in the evening and midnight. "8. That each slaughter-house be provided with adequate accommodation or poundage for the cattle apart from the place where the meat is stored, and that the animals be not kept therein for more than twelve hours before they are killed, and that calves be not kept in any pound or slaughter-house between the hours of six o'clock in the evening and six o'clock in the morning. "9 That the way of access for bullocks to the pound or slaughter-house be not through an inhabited house. "10. That a copy of these rules and regulations be affixed and retained in a conspicious place in every licensed slaughter-house, and from time to time renewed, so as to be always in a legible and perfect condition." It is also recommended that in the case of the several licensed slaughter-houses which had not been used for two years or more, the license should be withdrawn. 7 There can be no doubt that it was the intention of the legislature, in passing the Metropolitan Building Act, 7 & 8 Vict., cap. 84, to prevent the slaughtering of cattle in crowded neighbourhoods, but the provisions of the act have not been enforced, because no public body was specially authorized or required to pnt the act into execution. All applications for the licensing of newly erected slaughter-houses in the district, have been opposed by your Board, such places being considered contrary to the provisions of the above recited Act. A new slaughter - house has, however, been erected at Saint Katherine's Steam Wharf, and also at the Dublin Wharf, in conformity, as it is alleged, with the regulations of the Board of Trade, requiring the immediate slaughter of all diseased or injured animals, immediately on their arrival in port; and upon these grounds, the Board did not oppose. Before concluding this report, I wish to draw the attcntion of the Board to the nuisance arising from the numerous laystalls and dung-heaps, which are usually to be seen in the yards adjoining stables and cow sheds, upon which the refuse, from the neighbourhood, and from the small slaughter-houses in the vicinity, is thrown. The contents of privies have also been found flowing into these heaps, which are allowed to accumulate until the quantity will pay for their removal. The effluvium, emitted from the stirring up of each of these putrifying masses, is filthy in the extreme, and must have a prejudicial effect upon the public health. Now, in order to prevent the injurious consequences of these abominations, all filth, dung, garbage, and refuse, should be removed daily from the premises of stables, cow-sheds, slaughter-houses and other places, so that they shall not have time to putrify and infect the atmosphere. I am induced to lay stress upon this point, because complaints have been made by some of the inhabitants of the nuisance arising from the removal of dung and other filth from stables and cow-yards, where it is allowed to accumulate in sufficient quantity to make it worth the person's while to remove it. The only effectual way of getting rid of this nuisance will be by the employment of a contractor to collect and remove out of the district all such filth daily, whereby the formation of these dung-heaps will be prevented. As complaints have also been made of the nuisance arising from cow-yards and stables, I would respectfully advise the Board to insist upon such places being provided with an effectual system of underground drainage, so that the offensive matter shall not flow over the surface, thereby causing great annoyance and discomfort to the inhabitants in the vicinity; more especially when the filth is being swept towards the nearest gulley. The abolition of cesspools is, where practicable, steadily carried into effect, (65 having been abolished during the last three months, making a total of 1605), the beneficial result of which is shown in the diminution of fever cases. The evils to the public health from the keeping of swine are also very great, and, notwithstanding the several convictions which have taken place in your district on that account, it requires the constant vigilance of your inspectors to detect and prevent the recurrence of the nuisance. One hundred and seventy-eight houses have been systematically visited by your inspectors during the last quarter; the sanitary improvements effected therein will be 8 seen on referring to the tables in the appendix. A butcher was fined 20s. and costs, for using an unlicensed slaughter-house. The penalty of 20s. and costs, was inflicted upon a person exposing for sale meat unfit for human food, and the meat was ordered to be destroyed. I have visited some schools and public buildings in the district, for the purpose of considering the state and efficiency of the ventilation, and in those cases where I thought it defective, I made such suggestions as the case seemed to require. Here, I may remark, that the ventilation of the Board-room is very defective, and it requires your immediate attention; for I feel convinced that some of those gentlemen who are regular in their attendance, will sooner or later feel the injurious effects of breathing the poisonous air which is generated in this room when many members are present, unless effective means are taken to get rid of the products of respiration and the combustion of gas. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LIDDLE. Board of Works, 15, Great A lie Street. APPENDIX. TABLE I.
